This is gonna be a rough guide mainly and with the help of the arena rules, should help prepare anyone with the basics knowledge of how to Fight in the roleplay style.<br> <br>
Any information any feels is missing or should you find something wrong with this information, please do not hesitate to inform me of this via PM and i will update and/or add your suggestions to the thread. You will of course be credited with this.<br> <br> <b><font size="5">Close combat fighting</font></b><br> <br>
As the titles suggests, this section is dealing mainly with the use of "manual" weapons Such as bodily appendages(fists, elbows, knees, feet and any part of your body used as a weapon) and non-projectile weapons that require some sort of impact.<br> <br> <font size="3"><i>Bodily appendages</i></font><br>
The most important thing to realise about using your body as a weapon it that it is always going to be availible for use when in close combat. The second most important thing to realise is that using your body as a weapon, you can hurt yourself just as much as you hurt your opponent. I'm sure anyone who's thrown a punch and then hurt their hand as a result is painfully aware of that fact.<br> <br>
When using your body you've really gotta make sure you understand what your doing and then explain this well enough for the opponent to understand as well. If you leave a grey patches in your fighting explanations, people will likely exploit them or you yourself may well exploit the situation which is really not accepted. <br> <br>
Example: Say someone has closed up to your character in a fight and you feel the best thing to do is to punch them in the face. Should you post something like this: <div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px; "> <div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:2px">Quote:</div> <table cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td class="alt2" style="border:1px inset">
			
				*Person a swings a punch at person b*
			
		</td> </tr> </tbody></table> </div>I don't think i need to point out whats wrong with that. But i'll give you a proper example now: <div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px; "> <div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:2px">Quote:</div> <table cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td class="alt2" style="border:1px inset">
			
				*Seeing person B run towards him, person A quickly plants his back foot to the floor, locking his knee and shifting his weight forwards as he begins to pull his arm back. Person A spots an opening (suggesting you actually have, don't just make things up!) As Person B closes up to him fast and puts as much force as he can muster into sending his fist towards person b's face, aiming for person b's nose. Should he connect the likely result would surely be a broken nose and the collision between face and fist would likely send the person off balance, the shock of the impact adding to the effect.
			
		</td> </tr> </tbody></table> </div>Explain where the punch is going, what type of angle it's attempting to hit at, your body position, amount of force your punching with etc etc...Description is key, not only with bodily weapon combat but with all types of fighting and roleplay in general, learn to do this as a automatic thing and you'll only get better and better at roleplay no matter what your doing.<br> <br>
This type of thing is the cornerstone of fighting and im sure any budding beginners would do well to learn it. Also as a note, pretty much all parts of your body can be used but be sure to keep in mind the basics of doing this.<br> <br>
AS A SIDE NOTE: Remember that the recipient or your attack might well be wearing some form of armour. For instance should you land a punch on someone's chest when their wearing plate armour, your not only gonna look quite the fool but you'll hurt your hand quite badly, unless you yourself are wearing some type of hand armour E.G. a pair of plate mail gauntlets or such.<!-- google_ad_section_end --> </div>   <div class="smallfont"> <hr size="1" style="color:#333333; background-color:#333333"> <em>

Also known as "melee" weapons, this particular section is all about the faithful sword, dagger, mace etc etc. Melee weapons come in all sorts of sizes, shapes, lengths and uses. I would define a melee weapon as something that is not a physical part of your body and requires you to hold it or otherwise wear it, but also does not fire projectiles. If you've a sword that fires blasts of fire at someone, just refer to both the magical section and projectiles when firing the blasts, otherwise it's gonna be a melee weapon.<br> <br>
Now, some ground rules for "Hand held impact" weapons. The first thing to take into consideration is that these weapons need to be used with some knowledge of what they are good at doing. Along with this knowledge is the type of ways particular variants are used. Some weapons are good for wading through hordes, hacking and slashing anything in range, others require poise and precision timing, one strike = one kill. <br> <br>
I just hit on my next point, different types of melee weapons will have different ranges, in particular both a minimum and maximum range. Getting up close to a person can make their longsword useless cause they can't swing the blade at you, oppositely you can try and stay out of the swing range of the person and again the weapons useless. These points are crucial to remember when using melee weapons, you must always remember that to use them properly you must keep the target within the effective range and that will mean precision movement of your character to bring the best out of the weapon.<br> <br>
I will next give more in depth examples of melee weapon types and their practical uses.<br> <br> <b>Slicing</b>: A slicing weapons is one that will use the sharpness of the blade to do the most damage. The damage you inflict however will be mostly flesh damage, however the heavier types of slicing weapons could quite easily go through bone as well. Slicing weapons aren't generally heavy duty and are ill suited to direct hacking motions. A good example of this is the old fabled "samurai" sword. Made famous by the elite warriors, "samurai", this weapon is deadly when in the right hands. It concentrates on single strikes that utilises the benefits of the uber sharp blade. This essentially means sweeping motions that "drag" the blade across the point of impact, causing the blade to cut and sink in, causing more and more damage as it gets deeper and deeper. the result is typically a wound that is extremely clean and straight. This however requires a lot of knowledge in how to wield effectively. Less damaging but easier to use slicing weapons include most daggers and swords that fit the above description of damage type.<br> <br> <b>Hacking</b>: This type of weapons utilises a heavier blade type and, as the title suggests, hacks into the target using brute force and momentum to cause damage. This is generally a good type of weapon to use when people are wearing heavy armour, as even if the weapon simply impacts the armour, should the attack be struck with enough force, it will simple bludgeon the enemy with crushing force. The most famous type of hacking weapons is the "bastard" sword (titles because it's dual ability to be wielded with both one and two hands) this type of weapon was used mainly during the middle ages when the process of a twisted iron and steel core added the necessary strength to deliver the crushing blows without the blades bending or breaking. It requires very little skill to use as the blows struck with it are very crude in their effectiveness, along with most weapons under this title. These weapons are, though, generally quite heavy, requiring someone of a very strong build to wield for long periods, further suiting the heavy blows that are struck with it, but they can be quite unwieldy when used by someone less than barbaric physique. Also any axes come under this bracket of weapon too, since they rely more of the heaviness of the axe head, than the sharpness of the blade edge.<br> <br> <b>Piercing</b>: These types of weapons are used to punch holes into targets, much like a bullet. Generally very thin and long, coming to a fine point, these work with thrusting strikes that utilise the thin point of the blade. These are however very ill suited to blocking any types of strikes from other weapon types, because they are very light weight in design with the blade rather flexible to prevent the blade breaking under the tremendous force of punching a hole through, say, plate armour. One particular weapon that comes under this type is the type of dagger that was used by archers during the middle ages. The blade is typical of a piercing weapon and was used to find the weak points of armour when the archers "mopped" up after battles or by assassins that wished to suddenly pierce a victim by surprise, causing fatal, but non-messy wounds that might leak blood everywhere and attract notice.<br> <br> <b>Bludgeoning</b>: This weapon type is the least used, but possibly the most devastating when used properly. The weapon doesn't generally have any cutting edges, but relies on the shear weight of the weapon and the strength of the blow to inflict serious crushing blows that will almost negate any armour the target is wearing. But this weapon type does have some serious disadvantages. The weight of the weapon generally means that the strike ratio is considerably slower than other weapons and therefore the blows are easier to spot coming, this added weight also has the disadvantage that the user can tire very quickly. Also the heavier (and hence more damaging) weapons generally have to be held with two hands, meaning no shield hand. But should your character happen to be some huge conan the barbarian type then wielding such a heavy weapon wont be a problem. Bludgeoning weapons have quite a lot of variance in them, coming in the generally single hand wielded mace, up to the double handed warhammer. Also the "flail" (spiky ball on a chain) type weapons come into this bracket and get and extra note. Flails are actually the one bludgeoning type weapon that is quite flexible (think Gogo from kill bill XD). The chain meaning that it can be swung around really quite fast, adding extra momentum to the blows, but at no extra weight cost! Also the chain can be used in a range of ways, including wrapping around a weapon to potentially disarm an opponent, or wrap around someone's appendage (e.g. leg) to potentially pull them off balance. This does have the disadvantage of someone being smart enough to tie up the chain, thereby taking your weapon out of action until you can retrieve it.<br> <br> <b>AS AN END NOTE TO THIS SECTION, THIS GUIDE IS ONLY A BASIC GUIDE AND I WOULD NOT SUGGEST SIMPLY READING THIS AND HAVING DONE WITH YOUR RESEARCH ON HOW TO USE YOUR WEAPON, WHATEVER WEAPON TYPE YOU ARE ATTEMPTING TO USE, IF IT'S NEW TO YOU, I WOULD STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT YOU RESEARCH HOW TO USE IT FIRST. <br> <br>

Right form the off I'm gonna try and impress the fact that I'm no firearms expert, I do know a basic knowledge of the progression and such, but things like that aren't really good for a guide such as this.<br> <br>
Okay basic rules for the use for projectile weapons: Make sure you chose weapons suitable to the part of history/Modern era/future, choosing to use an M16 in a thread set in the imperial age is just stupid. <br> <br>
Second rule, try and have a basic knowledge of how the weapon works, fire functions, how to reload that sort of thing otherwise your gonna have very little to work on when using your weapon other than just firing. <br> <br>
You should also have some knowledge of the practical uses of the weapon you chose, a 12 gauge might be kick ass but firing at anything with any sort of range and you'd do more damage throwing the weapon at them. <br> <br>
Next you should keep in mind the weight of the weapon, this should also include extra ammunition, so many times I've seen people that think they could jump around as if they're a feather when they're carrying a missile launcher or some other encumbering piece of weaponry. This is such a common mistake and something that ticks me off quite a bit.<br> <br>
Another thing to bear in mind. While running, your aim is impaired significantly, anyone who thinks they can run and fire a weapon accurately is seriously having a laugh. Please bear that in mind. While you may think it's cool to go on a rambo style rampage and run through hordes of generic idiot bad guys while firing a magical rifle that somehow makes all the bullets hit their mark, it really isn't cool at all. In fact, it's just plain stupid. Unless your in a comedy Rp, then maybe it's acceptable in a mad parody kind of way.<br> <br>
Common sense is your biggest ally when using weapons that fall into this category. I know roleplaying is not real, but the mark of a true roleplaying skill is making it very believable, and that means plausibility, in short: Realism.<br> <br>
For all the above information you should be able to find a site that provides all sorts of specifications on weapons both old, existing and prototypes for the nearer future for other bits you'll just have to use some common sense. I will attempt to find such a site and post the link to it in this section at a later date. <br> <br>
Okay next i will try and give some ground rules on futuristic weapons. If your joining a futuristic thread, it's more than likely that you'll end up using some sort of weapon that only some super egg head genius could ever fathom how it works. One thing to bear in mind though, while these weapons will be superior compared to modern day weapons, so will the armour. For example, warhammer 40k weaponry is in some cases rather advanced and deadly, but certain units will have armour that can deal with that on par. <br> <br>
The thing to try and NOT do with futuristic is the "mine is bigger than yours" argument...boy does it get boring so very quickly. Just don't go overboard with the spec of your weapon and you can't go wrong. <br> <br>
==========================<br> <br>
Okay this is a section i thought i should add on just for those who truely are "greenhorns". Certain weapons are just not to be used in RP'er vs RP'er fights. The generally agreed "fair" rules state that no attack can "auto-hit" of not be able to be evaded in some plausible way, in some cases this must simply be the case and you should really concede the hit and try to minimise the damage as best you can. But certain weapons fall under the generally agreed <b><i>BANNED</i></b> section of weapons that follows:<br> <br>
Orbital strike cannons, Nuclear strikes, Air strikes or any other "mass area of effect" weapon: Seriously dudes...as much as these might be cool to completely obliterate an opponent there are simply a no go area as far as use in a one on one fight situation. Putting a planet under siege? fine use orbital cannons. Planning on a crippling pre-emptive strike against a enemy country? Nuclear strikes are definitely an option. Facing heavy armour as have no weapons effective against them? Call in a air-strike to level the playing fields. just don't think you can call in this type of support in a one on one fight or against other characters directly. Common sense and fairness is the best thing you can employ.<br> <br>
There are weapons that are almost impossible to evade damage from and can't really be banned. Flame-throwers are once such weapon i can think of straight off the top of my head. Calling for a ban against these just isn't realistic, they are weapons that have been used on the battlefields for YEARS now. These are pretty high in the "cool factor" but really do need to be used in the right situation and used correctly. One major down factor is that your ammunition is very scarce and what you carry with you will run out quick if you run around like a crazy dude wielding it like some sort of crazed asylum escapee. If you simply must use these try not to do so in one on one fights, it's just not fair really. In all cases just limit how much ammo you have and the range of the flame burst to make it fairer for all involved.<br> <br>
Lock-on or wire-guided weapons: Okay these too are used in warfare and have been fact for quite a long time. Again using these against people is just not fair. Do not use these directly against other people. The only exception i can think of with this rule is if some git is charging around in some tank, helicopter, plane or any other weapon platform, by all means blast them off this plane of existence if they're being bastards with that equipment (but only if they're being irresponsible, think of these as "retribution" weapons against those that god mode, I know i would. :arr )<br> <br>
That's pretty much all i can think of with this particular section. as ever i you feel something should be added or amended please do not hesitate to tell me.<!-- google_ad_section_end --> </div>   <div class="smallfont"> <hr size="1" style="color:#333333; background-color:#333333"> <em>

Here is where the fairly straight route of logical weapons and fighting suddenly veers off down a dark and twisty road with many many different forks and junctions. <br> <br>
Magic is and always will be the hardest weapon to use effectively, properly and fairly. The realms of what you can do with magic is almost limitless and as such it can take almost any form and be used in almost any way imaginable. And that's the thing, Imagination. Magic is not something based off of a reality or a logical progression of mathematics and science. It is based off of the limits of imagination.<br> <br>
I will however try as best i can to give you people who feel the need for some extra advice/guidance some sort of help.<br> <br>
It's probably easier to start with the things you should try to avoid as a magic user.<br> <br>
Going gung ho is something to seriously avoid if you can. Magic versus magic can be baffling at the best of points without even bothering with the element types and strengths, If you complicate matters by firing off spells like a machine gun then things are gonna get messy and just damn complicated.<br> <br>
Something to remember is, all magic can be blocked. If the spell your using can't logically be blocked, then your probably god-modding. Examples would be sucking the entire galaxy into a crushing void, or exploding the earth in some stupid way or anything that can't be blocked. Of course, the other person could well just explode the world back at you and you end up with some stupidly OTT magic fight and as such it points out what i meant about being hard to use realistically.<br> <br>
Try not to be too flamboyant. I know that forum roleplaying is all about how eloquent you can be with words and how well you can portray what your doing as actually being a possibility, but there really is no reason the end up throwing a thesaurus at you fellow combatant. SO many times i've seen people use words the you could question even exist, in an attempt to make that spell seem even better than it is. Just try to explain yourself in a completely logical and progressive manor. By all means be descriptive, just don't don't act like the bigger and more complicated words you use will the magic bigger and better.<br> <br>
Try not to go OTT with you spells. I know you could very well go tearing up the world in an attempt to best your opponent, but i actually find that if you keep the spells relatively small on the area of effect the fight will be far more enjoyable and rather quick paced. Since roleplaying is supposed to be fun (more than anything else) making the playing ground as equal as possible is a good thing, cause the contest is then equal and can tilt in either direction, meaning it really is the "best man wins".<br> <br>
Now we reach the real "bone of contention" in the realms of magic. Elements.<br> <br>
Now anyone who's fought with magic knows that while the type of magic your using my be kick ass, it's always weak against another type of magic that's directly opposed to it elementarily. Below is a table with most of the basic elements and their weakness.<br> <br>
Element-Weak against<br> <br>
Fire-Water<br>
Water-Electricity<br>
Electricity-Earth<br>
Earth-Air<br>
Air-Fire<br> <br>
The above table is extremely basic, But useful none-the-less. <br> <br>
The real problem comes when using these types of magic against others which it is typically neither strong nor weak against. An example of this is water versus Earth. Now most people would say since water erodes the earth, that water would be stronger. But what if your using a particular variant of the magic element. Like say, earth magic in the style of nature and plants and such against simply water. Well plants need water to live, so simply put the water wouldn't really effects unless it massively overpowered it. But then perhaps the water magic style is ice, we all know frost kills plants. I wont continue onwards, but i think you get the idea that each branch of magic has several sub-categories that will make it more effective against some and yet weak against certain types of magic that it would normally be immune to. <br> <br>
It is with the above example that i would suggest the following: unless your a scientific type of person try not to dabble in magical elements that are far more complicated than the basic elements. You could very well end up in a long ass debate about magical elements that will probably leave you spitting feathers.<br> <br>
There is and always will be one argument that will rage on forever and no winner will ever be declared outright. Dark versus Light. It's a contest that can only be won by the strength of the cast magic, that's all. See they cancel each other out, without light there can be no dark, without dark there can be no light. <br> <br>
There is only one other type of magic that i've not talked about, conjuration. I'm only gonna say two things about it: Don't conjure endless supplies of minions, that kinda counts as god-modding. If you summon a weapon, try and stick to the outlines of close combat weapons above, obviously it's most likely gonna have magical elements but try and keep it reasonable. Those two rules kinda cover most of the bases, but if in doubt, ask a moderator if it's fair.<br> <br>
Well that's pretty much everything i can think of about magic. Again, as i had suggested with all other types of weapons, i would suggest that you do some background research of the particular magic branch you want to use, before you go throwing yourself into the deep end. It's a fairly elitist thing and unless your up to scratch, you can end up losing more than you win for a long time.<!-- google_ad_section_end --> </div>   <div class="smallfont"> <hr size="1" style="color:#333333; background-color:#333333"> <em>

I'm just here to give more details and improve upon, however, the rules he laid down as far as using them were amazing and I am fully behind.<br> <br>
First off, choice of weapon.  The firearm you choose should deal with the setting.  If your a civilian in a zombie RP, then it would be impossible for you to get your hands on anything with more power than a hunting rifle or a shotgun.  Same goes if your a soldier in some sort of military.  You won't get any spectacular .50 cal sniper rifle that everyone seems to love.  'Why wouldn't you get a .50 cal, Anarchy?!' You're probably thinking.  Well, I'll tell you why.  .50 cal rifles are anti material.  This is one of the things I'll be teaching you, though, so don't worry!<br> <br>
Alright, A weapons only as good as how its treated.  By that I mean, you have to be careful when you RP with a firearm.  Make sure you don't drop it in water, or something like that, because then, if your rping with me, as soon as you try to fire, I'll tell you that nothing happened because your bullets are wet.<br> <br>
Nextly, like Tsardel said, don't be running for miles and miles with a huge M249 SAW, and then pull the bad boy up and blow someone away from two miles with a headshot.  Three reasons; That particular gun, doesn't have that range, That particular gun is too inaccurate, three you won't be able to hold the thing after running that long with it.<br> <br>
The last thing, before the weapons, the things that hold bullets are not called 'Clips.'  They're magazines.  Clips are what the M1 uses, and if you have a clip, then you can't reload, you can only pull out a new clip.  This means that you'll have to carry a lot more clips than magazines since with a magazine you can just carry ammo and put the new ammo in the old magazine.  Not with clips.<br> <br>
Alright, after those three simple things I'll give you a compendium of common guns I see used.  If you want particular specs on a firearm, just PM me and I'll add it on.<br> <br> <br> <font size="5">Handguns!</font><br>
The Breakdown;<br>
The handgun, or pistol as y'all like to call it, is the side arm.  It's not powerful, it doesn't have amazing range, and it isn't automatic.  If your in a problem, however, it can be concealed, and its cheap.<br> <br>
Barretta 92<br>
Desc.<br>
This is the handgun everyone bases their generic 'Handgun' in the weapons option.  It's very simple, very light, and has a decent magazine size.  Before you put 'Handgun', just take the time to put down 92.  It has less words!<br>
Magazine Size<br>
Either 10, 15, 17, 18, 19, or 20 rounds, depending on the size.  They make two variant magazine sizes for this gun.<br>
Do I recommend?  For a simple, and handy sidearm?  You can bet your ass I do.<br> <br>
Desert Eagle<br>
Desc.<br>
The all famed .50 caliber handgun, right?  Wrong.  The Desert Eagle has a .44 round.  All the same, this is a powerful gun.  If you pick it, get ready for some kick.<br>
Magazine Size<br>
Either 9, 8, or 7.  Make your shots count.<br>
Do I recommend?  Meh.  I'd rather see you with a 92, as it has a bigger magazine size and a better firing rate.  A bullet is a bullet, all the same after all.<br> <br>
Heckler and Koch USP<br>
Desc.<br>
God, I love this company.  This gun weighs a little more than the 92, but its alright.  It makes up for it in that it can use 9mm rounds, .45 rounds, or .40 rounds.  You can also put a lot of accessories on this gun.  Going into a dark tunnel?  Put a flashlight in the underbarrel.  Got a character that isn't a trained expert?  Put a lasersight on the underbarrel.  If you get this gun for your character, you know what your doing.<br>
Magazine Size<br>
15, 13, or 12.  Not a lot, but it makes up for it like I said.<br>
Do I recommend?  Hell yes.  This is a great special operations gun, and a good civilian gun.<br> <br> <font size="5">Shotguns!</font><br>
The breakdown;<br>
A shotgun is your all-time close range buddy.  If your using a pellet shot, then your pretty much guaranteed to hit anything close, within 6 feet.  You can, however, use a buckshot for decreased spread and more range.  With said buckshot you can get at least 20 feet and still blow apart a good foot of a tree trunk.<br> <br>
Remington 870<br>
Desc.<br>
The all round shotgun.  It's pump action and can take 12, 16, 20, 28, and .410 bore gauges.  It's the most widely used shotgun in the U.S. for self defense, hunting, and target practice.  The police force also uses the gun quite a lot, using it as the main shotgun.  Did I mention its only 6 pounds?<br>
Feed System<br>
3 to 8 rounds, depending on size.<br>
Do I recommend? Yup.  It's like the 92, except a little bit more in my favor.<br> <br>
Winchester 1897<br>
Desc.<br>
What most people think of when they think shotgun.  It's got a wooden frame, and its pump action.  Sure, its old.  Sure, its heavy. (Weighs in at 8 pounds.)  But its reliable.  Its cheap.  And it comes in two gauges; 12 and 16.<br>
Feed System<br>
5, plus one in the barrel.<br>
Do I recommend?  You gotta world war I RP coming up?  Go for it, bud.  Zombie?  Yup.  WWII?  It was still kicking ass.  Your modern special ops?  Hell no.<br> <br>
Pancor Jackhammer<br>
Desc.<br>
When you think 'Automatic Shotgun' you probably think 'HELL YEAH!'  Well, not after this gun.  This is the only fully automatic shotgun known, and its hella expensive.  There are only about 500 made, and they cost up in the millions.  If your in an RP and you have this, you better have a strong arm, for the kick, and a good explanation.  Mounting it might help with the kick.<br>
Feed System<br>
10 rounds in a drum magazine.<br>
Do I recommend?  No.  Plain and simple.<br> <br> <font size="5">Submachine Guns!</font><br>
The Breakdown'<br>
Used by special forces and swat worldwide, these babies are the true close quarter masters.  They can go from semi-automatic to burst to fully automatic, and their accurate, too.  These are great if you can come up with an explanation for them.<br> <br>
Heckler and Koch MP5<br>
Desc.<br>
This and the Uzi are the two guns that come to mind when I think SMG.  This gun has so many variants, I don't even know half of their names, much less their specs.  It's a great gun, though.  800 rounds a minute, and an effective range of 25-100 meters in this small package are great.<br>
Magazine size<br>
15 or 30 round magazine.<br>
Do I recommend?  Sure do, as long as you got an explanation.<br> <br>
Uzi<br>
Desc.<br>
This thing is tiny, and it packs a punch.  With 600 rounds a minute, and an effective range of a shotgun, just get close and hold down the trigger.  You'll hit something, guaranteed.<br>
Magazine Size<br>
from 10 to 50 round magazines.<br>
Do I recommend?  It's alright, and it's cheap.   You can easily come up with one in an RP.<br> <br> <font size="5">Assault Rifles!</font><br>
The Breakdown;<br>
These are the guns that the military uses.  These are the top of the line.  If you have one and a good explanation, then go kick some ass, 'cause you'll have the best hardware there is.<br> <br>
AK-47<br>
Desc.<br>
It made sense to me to start out with the cheapest and oldest Assault Rifle still in use.  This thing is heavy, 8 pounds, and its clunky, and its ugly.  But it won't break, its cheap, and its got a big round, .30 caliber.  Did I mention how cheap it was?<br>
Magazine size<br>
30 rounds on the banana magazine.<br>
Do I recommend?  If you can't get your hands on a different rifle, yeah I do.  Use it on semi-automatic for best accuracy, though.<br> <br>
M-16<br>
Desc.<br>
The armies new swiss army knife.  This gun has four different variants and now it has a carbine.  It's reliable, its fairly cheap, but its heavy, 8 pounds.  It also has a great range, 550 meters, and firing rate, 800 to 900 rounds per minute.<br>
Magazine Size<br>
Differing magazines.  The most popular are the 15 and 30 round magazines.<br>
Do I recommend?  If you can get your hands on one with a good reason, You're going to kick ass, plain as can be.<br> <br> <font size="5">High Powered Rifles!</font><br>
The Breakdown;<br>
Normally I think this would be a waste, but people use them and people let people use them, so I will.  Just note, these are usually bolt action or semi-automatic and fire slowly.  Their also VERY heavy.<br> <br>
M21<br>
Desc.<br>
The Army marksmen rifle choice.  This is accurate and has a magazine, so you don't have to reload every shot.  Just note, its heavy, 11 pounds.  An Effective range of 690 meters makes it only slightly better than an Assault Rifle.<br>
Magazine Size<br>
5, 10, and 20 round magazines.<br>
Do I recommend?  Get a good reason, and yes.<br> <br>
M40<br>
Desc.<br>
The Marine marksmen of choice.  It's also accurate, but its bolt action, so make your shots count.  It's VERY heavy, 14 almost 15 pounds, but has an amazing range, 1000 meters.<br>
Magazine Size<br>
5 round magazine.<br>
Do I recommend?  Good reason and very, very far away?  Yeah, just show some professionalism and aim for the heart.<br> <br>
M82<br>
Desc.<br>
This is the one you've all been waiting for, the 'Light Fifty'.  This is the anti-material .50 caliber sniper rifle.  It's EXTREMELY heavy, 31 pounds, and has an AMAZING range, 1,800 meters.  You better have a good goddamn reason, though, because U,S, Special Forces are hard pressed to get this, and only the best of trained personnel get it.<br>
Magazine Size<br>
10 round magazine.  Yes, it's semi-automatic.<br>
Do I recommend?  If you are an ex-ranger and stole bill gates fortune <i>and</i> as strong as the hulk, go for it, 'cause you'll need to be rich, strong, and trained in its use.<!-- google_ad_section_end --> </div>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td class="alt2" style="border: 0px solid #333333; border-top: 0px"> <img class="inlineimg" src="./a-basic-guide-of-weapons-and-fighting-97_files/user_offline.gif" alt="AnarchyInthe865 is offline" border="0" title="AnarchyInthe865 is offline">

Now I'm only posting this up cause i said i would find it and post it up. Below i am posting the links to a site I use when i wanna find a weapon that's fairly unique OR if i wanna find the all the correct specifications for a firearm i've remembered from somewhere/something like a game or book or tv program.<br> <br>
To use the below site: select the type of weapon your after from the list on the top left. Then once you have you weapon sub catagory simply scroll down and in the side bar on the left hand side is the list a countries with individual weapons made by manufacturers in that country.<br> <br>
For instance: You want a handgun from central europe. Select handguns. Scroll down through the countries till you find one that suits (I'd Itay or germany or yugoslavia etc etc.) And then chose your weapon. ^_^ <br> <br>
Simple as can be.

				WS 2000 is very formidable weapon. It fires 20 gram (308 grains) tungsten dart (fleschette) with muzzle velocity of 1450 meters per second (4750 fps). At 1000 meters this projectile will penetrate a 40 mm of RHA (rolled homogeneous steel armour) and will result in serious secondary fragmentation effect behind the armour. That said, it will penetrate two walls of any modern APC at one kilometre range.
