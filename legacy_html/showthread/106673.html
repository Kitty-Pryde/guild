Tenshi Jigoku Academy was made for the purpose of educating the supernatural, the mythical, and the superhuman to blend in with the unknowing human world. However, even with the school's good intentions, chaos is abundant in these halls. It seemed to begin with the outbreak of a dark race called the Shadow Ghosts, who were controlled by thier Queen, the first headmaster, Alice. While posing as the Reaper King, her school was destroyed by an eccentric local diety, she was found out and once the school was rebuilt the throne was passed to a powerful but arrogant demon named Adian. Adian was part of a secret orginization called Wonderland, a small group of powerful demons and witches who's evil intent is unknown.<br>
<br>
We last left the residents of TJA on thier field trip to Florida. Upon thier return, the members of TJA found thier school in shambles after being visited by two more forces of darkness; A malicious emporess from another demension and a mysterious legion of rougue supernaturals. Shortly after most of the wreckage and fatalities were picked up after, the headmaster and the entire orginization of Wonderland vanished, leaving the school in anarchy. For quite a while no one knew how to keep the academy going, to the point it was nearly shut down, until one man stepped up to claim the title of headmaster; Sin Sieben, a catboy who just happened to be god of the universe. He sent everyone off on thier merry way for a week, assuring all he would rebuild the school in 7 days.<br>
<br>
Now in the month of June, the students enter the grounds. The original students return and the new come to enroll. But few know what's in store for them, for the academy is crawling with secret groups, sinister plots and hidden terrors.</div>

Tenshi Jigoku Academy welcomes all races, monster, yokai, human, you name it! Students live on the grounds, which is no inconvinence due to the school's massive and luxurious campus. Of course there are classes through the week, but they are not mandatory, nothing is really as long as the headmaster says so.<br>
<br>
As a student you're free to wander around, make sexy time, and naturally since Sin is such a <i>responsible</i> headmaster, fighting is allowed. In fact it happens frequently. Basically students can enjoy lives with friends, lovers, mortal enemies, but one must always remember this is not your average institute. The humans enrolled here usually don't know about the supernatural word around them, and even the creatures have things to fear. Rumors spread of orginizations and evil hidden in plain sight; the shadow ghosts possibly returning, the rampid ballistic ghoul fueling people's fears, the demonic orginization looming on the sidelines, hell even people from other dimensions are targeting the academy!<br>
<br>
Sign into our school and join the freakish and otherworldly as anything and everything can happen.</div>

As it is probably easy to figure out, this is the fourth addition of the series TJA. The original 3 were created by Sofyasama, who after her temporary ban (for IRL reasons) passed the thread on to me. My full title is the Mighty Overlord, Roo the It, but you can just call me Roo. This series flourished primarily because of four people who I've dubbed "The Four Alices", and this is what our stucture of power is based off of. <span style="text-decoration: line-through">I am GM, Darkgrey is my Co-GM, and Kuroku is my 3rd in command.</span> I am GM, Kuroku is Co-GM, and Darkgrey is 3rd in command.<br>
<br>
Of course aside from the Alices we have many veterans, who if they wish to return we would be more than happy to bring back, whether you want to use old characters or create new. We also welcome newcomers with open arms, and hope you'll become one of the family.<br>
<br>
Also, just as a little fun fact, the entire TJA story is currently being made into a webcomic by your's truely. It will take a long time to get through, but I rarely cut things out from the original script, so if you participate I will be adding you to said comic. This is why I'm OCD with posts being accurate to history...I apologize for my pickiness in advance ^_^"<br>
<br>
By the way...&gt;_&gt; I would like to give a shout out to <b>IVAN</b> and <b>ZELPH</b>, for sticking with us till the very end *in TJA3! LOVE YOU GUYS!!!</div>

<b><u>RULES</u></b><br>
•Roo is the GM. While it will usually be democratic with faithful members, but what It says goes. Kagamine is Co-GM, like the GM only not.<br>
•Do not post in the IC unless your CS is approved by the GM or whoever is in charge.<br>
•There will be BUTTLOADS of swearing, innappropriate language, violence and dark themes. It's alowed...hell it's ENCOURAGED, so I don't want to hear any whining.<br>
•Sex is to be kept in PM. I don't mind comedic or suggestive scenes but in general once the shaft is hoisted it's time to take it elsewhere.<br>
•Death of a character is usually the owner of said character's decision, unless someone in charge finds it nesseccary. (If you're going to go pissing off a really powerful character non-stop and expect to live, I <i>will</i> give the ok to kill your character)<br>
•No blowing up/disintegrating/burning down/sinking/crushing/teleporting/liquifying/any other means of destroying the entire school...unless you are DarkGrey<br>
•The OOC is meant for spam. It's like our member's lounge.<br>
•Do not post OOC in the IC if it is not relevant. If it has to do with what's going on in the IC, then I have no problem.<br>
•Those in charge can have guests in the OOC. Other members can ask for guest privilages. I can take away these privilages from any guests, which I will usually do if they've been hanging around too long or become irratating. Please not too many guests at a time! If you want full access to the OOC, then join!<br>
•I <u>WILL</u> ban people who become a nusciense or break rules.<br>
•2 students are required per dorm room. The dorms are Co-ed (since Roo is not a fan of gender division), and you may choose who you wish to room with, just get the pair approved by someone in charge (Mainly so I can write it down)<br>
•&gt;~&lt; Considering how many overly powerful characters have already been made...I can't completely deny godmodding. Only as far as xharacters go; <b>Godmodding a post is completely illegal</b>. But as far as making a character so powerful that it is Godmoddish (such as a FUCKIN' GOD or an ABSOLUTE ESPER), know that you will be allowed to use all that power BUT I am alowed to put my foot down with no complaints. If you want more freedom from my constant regulations, I advise making some restraints on your chara's power and ability.<br>
•You can feel free to make your own species, though it does not necessarily mean it will be approved. If you want to use a species already used by someone else, you have to follow thier standards for this species. Whoever uses the creature first gets rights to the rules about them (culture, history, ability, anatomy, etc.) In regards to this, see the creature list.<br>
<br>
<b><u>GENERAL CAUTION</u></b><br>
•If you join PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF FSM, STAY WITH US!!!! I urge you not to randomly drop out, as it often causes problems in posting, plans and my webcomic.<br>
•Here at TJA, we are known as "Demon Posters", because this <u>free</u>, and we take advantage of that to the fullest. Things will go by fast at times, so don't throw a hissy fit if you can't keep up.<br>
•<b>THIS IS A TOTAL PET PEEVE OF MINE</b> I completely understand wanting to make powerful characters, and I'm fine with that, but please make sure they are balanced somewhat. I do not enjoy watching fights with characters COMPLETELY untouchable. I don't mind ridiculously powerful charas, just as long as they aren't like invincible. (not the same as immortal. I don't really mind immortals.)<br>
•If you need a recap, just ask me ^_^ I'm good with them because I read pretty much everything. Just don't ask for a recap if it's only 2 or 3 pages...<br>
•We also do "Rolecall", which is basically asking everyone to post <u>in the OOC</u> where thier characters are located.<br>
•Please don't flood the IC with pages and pages of Back-And-Forth! This is when no one else is posting except two people, and then the rest of us have to go through all of that to find our posts. If there is too much B&amp;F then just hang out in the OOC until the thread becomes more active. Otherwise Roo may have to set posting limits while it's offline.<br>
•We are a very open and mature (as in rated M, not the opposite of childish) group. We can touch on pretty much any subject, so if you are easily offended this is not the place for you.<br>
•This is the fourth installment of TJA, so expect many inside jokes you won't likely understand. If you <i>really</i> want to get it, read the previous threads.<br>
•Since this series is so developed and ongoing, we are very skeptical of n00bs. We won't turn you away just because you're new or anything judgemental like that, but we expect a satisfactory CS. It doesn't matter if you're experienced or not, if we don't see potential in your CS we'll reject it. Simple as that.<br>
•If I flat out reject you because of a lacking CS, and you continuously try to enter another CS, I won't accept it. It's one thing if I reccomend revising it, but if I turn you down without any suggestion, it's best to just walk away. I much more appriciate someone who undervstands we have standards than someone who just can't take a hint. NO MEANS NO.<br>
•Despite my harsh opinion on turning down people, if you lack experience, want suggestion on what would be accepted or just need help, feel free to ask me, preferably via PM. I am happy to help and am quite frankly impressed with those who go to such lengths.<br>
•Offensive characters are not exactly foreign to TJA. Please keep in mind that characters do not necessarily refect thier owner's view. It's called "staying in character".<br>
•Though destroying the school is illegal, since violence is without a doubt going to happen, property damage is frequent and perfectly fine. We have staff for that.<br>
•Please use Original Characters, not ones that already exist in animes and the like.<br>
<br>
<b><u>USER CAUTION</u></b><br>
•Roo is crazy bipolar. Don't be surprised when it's personality changes weekly, daily, hourly, CONSTANTLY!!!<br>
•Roo is an it. I am not a he, or a she. I am genderless, and would happy to explain my reasons but please do not bug me about what my real gender is...<br>
•WARNING; DARKGREY IS FROM CANADIA!!! THEY DO CRAZY SHIT THERE, BRO!!!<br>
•Misuse of the word "Lunatic", flaunting red velvet and other wreckless behavior will more than likely result in being beaten and tortured by the Lunatic God, Kuroku. And most of these times if you piss her off you're on your own.<br>
•Some of us have voices in our heads or lively characters that decide to spring to life and join the OOC.<br>
•We have a couch. It is Tatoba's couch. You may use his couch, but beware: He might get sassy.<br>
•Keep all sprites away from Kaga; She will glitch up your shit.<br>
•This thread may contain bronies, furries, trolls, pedos, stalkers, otakus, psychopaths, incubators, nymphomaniacs, trolls, godmodders, shippers, and....stuff.<br>
•MAKING SENSE AND HAVING SANITY IS NOT REQUIRED AT ALL TIMES<br>
•Many members of TJA are violent, insane and fucked up enough to warn you that we can't be held responsible for any physical or mental injury, dementia, emotional turmoil, or exposure to massive amounts of otakuism. VEIWER DISCRESTION IS ADVISED.<br>

Name: Amachi Yoshiatamo<br>
<br>
Age: 16<br>
<br>
Gender: Male<br>
<br>
Race: Demon, he used to think he was a human.<br>
<br>
Personality: kind, caring, very shy around females, easily distracted, becomes very lazy when bored, easily angered when made fun of, curious, tends to daydream, he is often to trusting, he will go great lengths to help the people he cares about, he has a fear of birds, no sense of direction, hates to study, doesn't like arrogant people, he likes to cheer people up and feel depressed when he can't help them.<br>
<br>
History: he never knew his real parents for he was dropped off at a orphanage when he was a baby, and lived there until the age of 9 when he was adopted by a red haired woman who was, in his eyes, his real mother. After living together for sometime he fell in love with a blonde haired girl who lived next door to him and his mother. Within the next four years he and the blonde haired girl, who's name was Samantha, admitted their feelings for each other and were always together, until one day she was killed when she was walking home from school. The police had no idea to who or actually what killed her, and then shortly after his mother died from a illness she has had since birth, but not before she could tell him that he was special, that he was different then most people, and that he could find the truth about himself at Tenshi Jigoku Academy, thus that is where his story truly began two years later when he reached it.<br>

When Amachi first arrived at Tenshi Jigoku Academy, he was greeted by Cree who asked if he needed any help. Amachi had then asked her to show him around the school since he was new, and she leaded him to the main office of the school, as they then parted ways. As the day progresses, Amachi had eventually gotten lost in the school, due to him having no sense of direction, and Alice had appeared behind him, who told him that she could help him. Umeko had suddenly walked up to Alice and had then started speaking to her about how she was waiting for Alice to come back, and that she got bored and ate a police officer and then they started speaking about how he tasted, that was when Amachi had decided to back away from them and continue on his way. Eventually he had given hope of finding his room and fell asleep in the hallway.<br>
<br>
When he had woken up he continued to walk through the hallway, where he eventually found Sora, and Amachi had then asked her for help in finding his room. Sora had leaded him to the front door of his room, where they had talked for a bit and Amachi had found out that Sora was the daughter of the ruler of the underworld, and that the last school was blown up. They eventually decided to explore the school together, as they were both still new to this school, and Amachi told her his reason that he went to this school, because his mother told him that he could find out who he really was in Tenshi Jigoku Academy. They had continue to talk to each other, as they eventually reached the cafeteria where they decided to get something to eat. While they continued to talk, Sora had an idea to find out a way for him to figure out who he was, which was for Amachi to meet her father. Amachi eventually agreed, as Sora then lead him to the underworld where they talked to her father, and they found out that Amachi was a demon, and they went back to the school. After they had arrived back at the school, Amachi walked Sora back to her room, as Sora then kissed him on the cheek and went inside of her room, it was then that Amachi slowly started to grow feelings for Sora, as he then went back to his room and fell asleep on his bed.<br>
<br>
When Amachi had awoken he decided to get himself something to eat, as he reached the cafeteria and got himself a snack. Sora had then entered the cafeteria and saw Amachi, as she then called his name and ran over towards him. They then started talking about the school field trip to Florida, as eventually, after they had went to the store and Amachi had gotten himself some swimming trunks, they went into Sora's room where Sora had modeled her new bikini for him, and after Sora had changed back, they started talking about the fact that one or both of Amachi's parents had to been demons, and what he was going to do now. Having no idea on what he should do, he decided to change the subject, as he then asked Sora out on a date which she agreed to. They then went to a burger joint where they ate and talked to each other, as they enjoyed the date they were having. They then headed back Sora's room, they talked about how to use his powers, and about if him being a demon was what his mom wanted him to find out. After a while longer, they then started talking about the people at the school, and eventually the conversation lead to Amachi and his last girlfriend who was killed. After a bit more talking, the conversation then switched to Sora and the fact that she was engaged, and that her boyfriend had died as well.<br>
<br>
Some time had passed, while Amachi and Sora grew slightly apart due to them not talking as much, as it was then time for the field trip. As everyone was getting off of the plane in Florida, Amachi spotted Bright standing all by herself, as something told him to talk to her. After talking for a bit Amachi realized that she was all by herself, and then they decided to travel together for the reminder of the trip. Bright's personality seemed to have changed slightly, she seemed happier all of a sudden, as they started to explore the area Vix had suddenly appeared before them and after Vix had told Bright to die, her eyes went blank and she fell into Vix's arms, gasping for air. It was then that Amachi's demon powers started to activate, as he tried to save Bright from Vix, but then Vix summoned an exact copy of Amachi to slow Amachi down, while Vix then escaped through a portal. Amachi quickly attacked his copy, but he wasn't able to kill it because he was in a rush to chase after Vix, as he then went through the portal that Vix had created. The portal led to the interior of what appeared to be a standard home, though the only furniture was a simple couch. Vix was sitting on the couch, and beside him laid a small, purplish haired girl, sleeping. It was there that Vix explained more of what Bright and he were.<br>

Name: Avin<br>
Age: 16<br>
Gender: Male<br>
Race: This race's name is unknown, but it is basically a shadow monster like race..... but he is in his human from and he thinks he is human, and he doesn't know that the other from even exists. (If the GMs want me to explain it more, I will. He will also gain a various amount of abilities involving manipulating the shadow and using it as a physical from of attack and such, the more the story progresses...)<br>
Personality: He is shy, quiet, and tends to be anti-social. He loves to paint and play the piano, also loves to read books. He can keep his cool in most situations. He tends to think to much about things, he also tends to always think negative about things. He will go great lengths to be there for his friends or loved ones if they really need him. He hates his life, he thinks it truly has no meaning compared to everyone elses. He is also absolutely afraid of the darkness. (This one might be taken away the more the story progresses......)<br>
History: He was found, as a baby, in an abandoned house by a young girl named Melissa Katreni, who then took him to her mother. After a long discussion, the mother and father decided to take him in and make him part of the family. As the years passed by, Avin always did whatever his family asked of him, trying to please them, and he was never told that you wasn't related to them by blood, that they were not his real family. Then one day, at the age of 13, his sister, Melissa, sat down next to him and told him the truth, thinking that he finally needed to hear it. Avin couldn't believe what she said, as he knew that Melissa would never lie directly to his face, so he then went to his parents to confirm this story. As the days passed by, Avin became distrustful of his family, even of his older sister, and started to separate himself from them, so to say. Then one day he woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of his family screaming, and as he went out of his room to see what was happening, he saw a strange black monster like figure standing over his sister's body, as she appeared to be barely breathing. The monster then slowly started to devour his sister, with it's razor sharp teeth biting down on every part of her body, as it devoured her sorta like a snake does with its prey. Avin quietly and quickly went back into his room, as he locked his bedroom door and hid underneath his bed, for fear of the monster coming for him next. The monster never came for him, as morning soon came, and the darkness faded. Every since then Avin has been afraid of the darkness, afraid that the monster will come back. That morning he left the house, after gathering what few belongings he owned. He didn't know where he was going, he just wanted to find some place that would be safe from that monster. For the next three years he traveled the world, walking from place to place, until he finally decided to work at a small business store that had two floors, which the owner said that he could gladly stay in the upstairs room for free as long as he worked in the store. After some time had passed, he eventually got a letter from an anonymous person which told him that there is a safe place in the world, a place where that monster would never reach him, and that place was Tenshi Jigoku Academy. Avin wondered who would send him a letter, but he decided that it was worth the chance to find a safe place, so he quickly packed up and said goodbye to the owner, who told him that he would always be welcomed here, and Avin then left towards Tenshi Jigoku Academy.<br>

Race: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120915032759/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakshasa" target="_blank">Rakshasa</a> (If you want me too, I can just find a easier way to explain the Rakshasa race and his powers......) <b>Here is a list of his abilities and powers:</b> Being a Rakshasa, he can shapeshift into different forms and people, he can make illusions seem so real that the people who he is doing the illusion on will actually think that they it is actually real. (If that made any sense..... Let's say he made an illusion of that person being stabbed then that person will actually think that he is being stabbed, but outside of the illusion that person isn't really being stabbed, so no real physical damage is done to them by the illusion, only mental damage.) He is also a magician and can cast various general spells, and his real body cannot physically age.<br>
Personality: His personality is basically a mystery...... he changes it to fit the role that he is playing at that time.....<br>
History: (Since he has lived for a really long time, I would hate to write it all out right now...... but if you guys want me too, then I will.)<br>

Name: Amachi "Ryusei"(Evil clone of Amachi created by Vix in TJAIII.)<br>
Age: Looks the same age as Amachi, but he has only been alive since the Florida trip in TJAIII.<br>
Gender: Male<br>
Race: He is a demon, just like Amachi.<br>
Personality: He is basically psychotic and insane, but he hides it well and tries to keep a calm and cool face unless he is around Amachi. He believes that his only reason to live is to kill the real Amachi, thus accomplishing what he was created to do. He is very distrustful of people, and sees friendship and love as nothing more then useless feelings and emotions that he does not need. (If this made any sense......) He is fearless and brave, but he still has the feeling that Amachi does, which is that he does not want to cause harm to others useless they deserve it in his eyes.<br>
History: Since Amachi kicked Evil Amachi's ass during Amachi's attempt to follow after Vix for revenge for Bright (during the Florida school trip in TJAIII), Evil Amachi lost track of the real Amachi and has traveled around from place to place looking for the real Amachi. During these travels he started to learn more and more of this world, and started to secretly like it. Then one day in a small bar, he overheard a young silvered haired boy and the bar owner talk about the Tenshi Jigoku Academy. (The silvered haired boy was Avin....) Evil Amachi decided that if Amachi was going to be anywhere in this world he would be at the new Tenshi Jigoku Academy school, thus Evil Amachi then made his way towards the new school, secretly following the strange silvered haired boy in order to find the way.<br>
Appearance: He looks like this picture, which is what Amachi looks like, but Ryusei has red eyes instead. <table class="ncode_imageresizer_warning" id="ncode_imageresizer_warning_2" width="294"><tbody><tr><td width="20" class="td1"><img src="./106673_files/wol_error.gif" width="16" height="16" alt="" border="0"></td><td class="td2">Click this bar to view the full image.</td></tr></tbody></table><img src="./106673_files/Sora_by_AnaKris.jpg" border="0" alt="" onload="NcodeImageResizer.createOn(this);" id="ncode_imageresizer_container_2" height="451" width="294"><br>

<br>
History: His past is much too long to tell.. but he has been with Latooni ever since she was born and he considers her his sister. They had a hard life, they were called freaks and weirdos is just about every town that they lived in, until they finally found a nice women who owned a hotel. She hated how people were treating them, and she decided that they could live in on of the hotel rooms for while till they figure out what they were going to do and go. A few months later, he was sleeping inside of a hotel room when Latooni walked up to him with a letter in her hands, a letter that invited them to a place where they would be accepted and where they could live in peace...and this place was Tenshi Jigoku Academy. Needless to say Kyo was very distrustful of this as it had seem to suspicious that they would randomly get a letter, but Latooni really wanted to go, so Kyo decided that it was better then nothing and then they started to travel towards the Tenshi Jigoku Academy.<br>

Name: Latooni<br>
Age: Looks about 15.....<br>
Gender: Female<br>
Race: Angel<br>
Personality: She is overly kind and nice. She is also very naive and dense about alot of things. She believes that everyone has good within them, even if they don't show it. She hates showing her true emotions, so she almost always acts happy and cheerful, even when something is greatly bothering her. She will only show her true emotions around people that she trusts, but not when she knows that they are going through a tough time. She also loves beautiful things, and she cares a great deal about other people, even when the other people are strangers to her. She also feels like she is truly alone in this world, even when Kyo is around her. She becomes very depressed when she is by herself, so because of this she tries to stick around people and make friends.<br>
<br>
History: She was raised by Kyo, who she has known her entire life. They moved from town to town, to avoid people who were treating them harshly, until they finally came across a nice women who let them stay in one of her hotel rooms. For a few months things were going alright, but Latooni and Kyo both knew that they would eventually have to start moving again. One day, while Kyo was sleeping in their hotel room, Latooni was out in the flower field a ways away from the hotel building. It was then when a man with short black hair had approached her and gave her a letter, and told her that this letter was for her and her brother, before walking away from her. She decided to take it to Kyo, who then told her what it said. Latooni was excited that they were invited to the Tensi Jigoku Academy, mostly because the letter said that they could meet other people like them there, and she greatly urged Kyo to take them there. Kyo hesitated at first, but eventually gave into Latooni's request and he then started traveling with her towards the Tenshi Jigoku Academy.<br>

        <div class="hider" style="display: none;"><b>Name:</b> It's real name, if it even has one, is unknown, but people have labeled it with the name The Slender Man.<br>
<b>Age:</b> This being appears to be ageless, and it is impossible to determine what it's real age could be, but it is said that it has lived for centuries.<br>
<b>Gender:</b> It is unknown what it's real gender is, but people have said that it looks like a man, so it is assumed that it's male.<br>
<b>Race:</b> What race this being is is currently unknown, but for now we shall call it a being that is it's own unique race that it is the only one of, I suppose, though it is possible that there is more then one of it's kind.<br>
<b>Personality:</b> It is also unknown what it's personality is like, but it is said that The Slender Man is a terrifying being that brings fright to people around it, but other reports have said that it can seem smoothing and comforting when it wants to be. (Trying to add more.)<br>
<b>History:</b> It's history is incredibly long and is sorta vague at different areas, what you have heard about The Slender Man is probably true. (A short record of what is known about this being will most likely be posted here shortly.)<br>
<b>Appearance:</b> One of the main issues facing Slender Man investigators in the fact that "his" appearance seems to be subjective, with reports varying largely from area to area. This is often put down to cultural bias, with the observer projecting his fears into the sighting and recollections being blurred. However, it is generally agreed that it's appearance is that of a pale, emaciated male figure, with an apparent height of between 7 and 9 feet tall. The figure is often described as wearing a black suit.<br>

        <div class="hider" style="display: none;"><b>Name:</b> Shinryu Yashima<br>
<b>Age:</b> 17<br>
<b>Gender:</b> Male<br>
<b>Race:</b> Observer (He used to think he was human.)<br>
<b>Personality:</b> He is quite kind and seems like a good person. He usually doesn't like to pry too much into other people's lifes, but his curiosity does get the better of him at times. He can seem pretty dense and naive sometimes. He tends to be easily embarrassed about certain things, but he tries to not let it become too noticeable, and may even try to say something to change the subject or make an excuse to leave. He recently started to become much more aggressive then he once was, though it is usually during combat and when he talks to people who he thinks are dangerous or who annoys him. He is very, very curious about the history of different races in the world. He believes that everyone deserves a second chance if they had done something wrong in their life. He refuses to take someone's life, unless he sees a good reason why he should, such as if it is the only why to stop that person from killing someone else.<br>
<b>History:</b> There isn't really much to say about his past before he found out that he was an Observer. He grew up in a small town where he lived with his mother, father and older sister. His father was very abusive towards him and his mother, while his mother was always overly kind and too caring. Shinryu's father was killed in a car crash when Shinryu was only 13 years old, and his mother killed herself soon after since she didn't want to be without his father. He and his sister then moved to a new town and into a new house, which was a few minutes drive from the closest town, with his uncle. During the next four years of his life he had only made a few friends from school, but he wasn't really all that close to them. His sister was always out and about doing whatever she wanted to do since their uncle was only home once every 2 weeks, so he basically had the whole house to himself.<br>
<br>
After a meeting with a strange woman, he was told that he was an Observer, a being that was from the fourth dimension, and this strange woman then took him to that dimension in order for him to know more about the world he never knew. It was there that he eventually met one of his real parents and a few strange people, one of which was a clone of a very powerful being who was brutally killed in her previous life. This real parent of his began to teach him how to use his abilities as an Observer, and he slowly started to become more and more powerful. Eventually he left the fourth dimension for his own secret reasons, and he decided that he would check out this place called "Tenshi Jigoku Academy" since he had heard so much about it. (There are a few other details here and there, and I'll add them in when I think of more.)<br>

He secretly yearns for the power, but he keeps it hidden very well. He always looks sorta suspicious, and he always seems to not be telling the whole truth about things, but he has proven time and time again that he can be a dependable and loyal person. He is willing to do almost anything to get what he truly desires.<br>
<b>History:</b> His past is completely shrouded in mystery, it just sorta seems like he appeared from nowhere without any reason whatsoever, but he seems to take an interest in Tenshi Jigoku Academy, and the people that live there.<br>

<b>Race:</b> She was the product of an experiment between a Necromaster and the shadow like monster race.

<b>Personality:</b> (working on this one, one moment. Will probably be quite short, sadly, but will try to make it long.)<br>
<b>History:</b> Her history is unknown, really, but what is known is that she lived in Lake Maplemount Village for a few years, and if strangely enough the only person left alive from that town, since the rest of the villagers disappeared mysteriously one night. She had signed herself up to Tenshi Jigoku Academy after hearing about how much exciting stuff goes on around there.<br>

<b>History:</b> Haruo Hisgomaro had has a pretty normal live, though there were a few bumps along the way. He has always been a loner, finding interest in books, reading manga, and writing stories then socializing with other people. He has never really had a true friend in life, since he never hanged out with anyone long enough to make a decent friend, and was usually alone in his home when he was growing up, while his parents were off working and taking trips. Eventually he decided to sign himself up for a new academy, one away from town where he lived in with his parents and such, and thus he decided on Tenshi Jigoku Academy. (Might add in more, since this seems a bit... plain, I guess.)<br>

<b>Age:</b> 15<br>
<b>Gender:</b> Female<br>
<b>Race:</b> Sumasumi. A race that can summon any item that they can think of at will. But, the more powerful the item, or if this ability is used too much back-to-back, then problems will occur, and can sometimes be fatal, depending on the situation.<br>
<b>Personality:</b> (Will finish eventually, along with Haruo and Lucina's personality as well.)<br>
<b>History:</b> She was found all alone in the streets by a man named Aiko, and he decided to take her into his house and give her a place to stay after seeing the situation she was in, feeling that she needed someone to help her out. Years had passed on by while she was there, as she started to call Aiko her big brother and treated him as such, often annoying him for her own amusement, though never too much at one time. Thanks to Aiko, her life started to get better, she went to school, had food, a room to herself, clean clothes, and was just overall better, though she felt sadden that she knew there was no way she could replay him for everything he had done for her. She then figured out about her unique ability, though when she told and showed her brother, he had told her to never use it around public, since it could cause problems for her. Fuyoko, being the way that she is, eventually went behind his back and used it constantly around other people. Sadly, as time passed on by, Aiko started coming home less often, and looked much worse each time he did. Fuyoko was beginning to get more and more worried about him, and had even stopped bothering him, thinking that was the reason he was coming home less. Then one day Aiko sat Fuyoko down and told her that he was working more and more to get more money, in order to pay the bills and such, but things have finally gotten worse, and they were going to lose the house. Though this was rather bad news, Aiko had also told her some good news, and that was she would still have a home, but that it would just be a different place and he would not be around. This place he was talking about was Tenshi Jigoku Academy, and thus, after much convincing from Aiko, Fuyoku decided to head to the Academy, saying her goodbyes to her brother, who told her that he would call her and let her know when he got another place for them, and to just have fun and to not worry about him.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Name: Kyouki Tohno -- Sheer Terror (Her nickname comes from those who dare defile books in front of her....)<br>
Age: Seventeen || Does it really matter? Yes? Fine. By Librarian years, she's 19.<br>
Gender: Female<br>
Race: Librarian -- A race birthed by the joining of demons and spirits, this race focuses more on simple...knowing. They are capable of summoning lesser and greater demons and spirits due to their connection to them, though they are very docile people for the most part. Telekenesis is a common power within the race, along with a strange...frenzy that can occur within the beings. When under a great deal of stress, they can enter a frenzy known as a 'Lunatic High,' in which they become amazingly aggressive, their strength is doubled, and their pain recipants simply...deactivate, making them immune to pain. Bloodless can still kill them, however. They are NOT very durabable in hand-to-hand combat, and as such rely on their summons to fight for them.<br>
<br>
Personality:<br>
Kyouki is an...interesting girl, to say. She can come off as cold when one first meets her, due to her not being the most friendly person. She tends to space out alot, which can lead to one thinking she's ignoring them. Despite these negative traits, she truly is a caring girl. Once you become her friend, she treats you like family, always making sure you have what you need. She's not the best leader, but she is one to rely on when it comes to orders, and does her best to make sure that whatever needs doing gets done. Kyou adores children to the point of becoming their surrogate mother if needed, and her entire demeanor changes when around them, going from cold to shining. Her goal in life is to try and make everyone happy, even if it means sacrificing her own happiness in the process.<br>
<br>
As far as it comes to her working, she has not much of a regard for her own health, and will take on everyone's work if someone doesn't stop her. She's prone to passing out every now and then from lack of sleep trying to finish all of the work she takes upon herself. But even with that, don't EVER think she'll complain, because she is incapable of doing so. This mindset usually gets her 'grounded' from doing too much.<br>
<br>
With relationships, Kyouki just...doesn't attempt to understand the concept of romance. She never really paid attention to it, because nobody ever really...tried to pursue her. Besides, to her, it gets in the way of her work. To try and break her out of this mindset would take quite some dedication. She doesn't exactly understand the concept of personal space much, and enjoys hugging people ALOT, should she get used to you.<br>
<br>
She has an extreme issue regarding people's hands anywhere near the back of her neck. There is an issue regarding it to where pressing down on a certain spot makes her really....bothered. If a person DOES manage to pull this off, she immediately freaks out, bulldozing down anything in her way to escape the scene and dunk her head in cold water or something in order to fix the issue.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
History:<br>
When she was alive, Kyouki had a...broken type of life, considering her family chose to try and blend in with the mortal realm. She usually spent her time working while her mother and her father screamed at each other. They were always at odds over money issues, so she got a job at the age of fifteen, assisting with cooking in a traditional chinese resturant. She never got to hang out with any friends, much less make permanent ones, due to the drama at her house. She herself was victimized by her parents, usually showing up to school hiding bandaged arms and other injuries from her teachers. But she never complained. To her, it was simply a normal thing. Something that families went through. It was when she was nineteen, that everything went wrong.<br>
<br>
Kyouki was walking to her home from her job, now the head chef of a gourmet resturant, and decided she would visit her parents. When she opened the door, she found her mother on the floor, dead. A bullet hole was in her head. Kyouki thought she was crazy, trying to wake her mother up, until she heard a gunshot upstairs. Suffering from denial, she walked up to her parents' room to find her father on the bed, bleeding out. A gun was in his hand. <br>
Kyouki screamed.<br>
<br>
She couldn't take it. She couldn't think straight. She took the gun, grabbed a box of matches, and went out side the house. She set it on fire, then brought the gun to her head...<br>
But it didn't work.<br>
She would later wake up within the Academy walls, and meet the school's librarian, who ironically enough, was a Librarian himself. Quite a position to fit his race. As it would turn out, he was a friend of her family's, and took her in, raising her. Since then she has lived within the school, listening to her new 'Father' and doing her best to make sure everyone is happy.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Name: Ahira Kamui -- The Allseer<br>
Age: 21|| Does it really matter? Yes? Fine. By Librarian years, he's 25.<br>
Gender: Male<br>
Race: Librarian -- A race birthed by the joining of demons and spirits, this race focuses more on simple...knowing. They are capable of summoning lesser and greater demons and spirits due to their connection to them, though they are very docile people for the most part. Telekenesis is a common power within the race, along with a strange...frenzy that can occur within the beings. When under a great deal of stress, they can enter a frenzy known as a 'Lunatic High,' in which they become amazingly aggressive, their strength is doubled, and their pain recipients simply...deactivate, making them immune to pain. Bloodloss can still kill them, however. They are NOT very durable in hand-to-hand combat, and as such rely on their summons to fight for them.<br>
<br>
Personality:<br>
Part of his personality should be a dead give-away considering the way he dresses. He usually retains a calm, is not amused, demeanor. Threats to him will only be responded to with excitement and anticipation. He doesn't mind voicing his opinion and enjoys having others...try, new things. It usually ends with one of two possible results...<br>
<br>
In regards to his co-workers, he can come off as a bit masochistic in that no threat really scares him. Sure, he knows when to stop, but he can hold his own in an argument. He holds his superiors to upmost respect and acts as such in situations that to not include time for humor. He can be INCREDIBLY flamboyant at times, but it's usually something he manages to catch before things get a little too...weird.<br>
<br>
Around children, Ahira acts like a big brother. He adores the little ones no matter what his personality might say otherwise. If asked a question that they should only learn later in life, he will simply give them another version of the answer, protecting their innocence. He can easily be invoked into a rage should a child be harmed, and will not stop at just harming a person. No, he will try to brutally murder them in a way that would make genocide seem peaceful.<br>
<br>
All in all, he is a very unique person. It’s extremely hard to scare him especially when he LIKES getting hurt, and one of the only major flaws of his personality is that he can’t handle being victimized, and will immediately fly into a frenzy to attempt to stop anyone or anything from trapping him.<br>
<br>
<br>
History:<br>
When he was alive, Ahira was sold into slavery in order to pay off his family’s debts. He was abused for many years, to the point of passing out from blood loss, for being disobedient to not only the men, but also the women who ‘owned’ him. He spent seven years floating from buyer to buyer, the scars fading each time only for new ones to be added. It was only at the seventh year that he was bought by a kind man. One who didn't want to hurt him, rather, protect him from the other sick bastards that had owned him previously. He was treated like royalty by this man, named Douji.<br>
<br>
It was when he turned sixteen that things became horrible yet again. It was a man, one who had had his sights on Ahira for a while, had his men gun down Douji and attempted to take the boy. The only thing that stopped him was Douji's will, which gave Ahira inheritance to everything he owned. Ahira would become a free citizen, with enough money to do whatever he wanted. Ahira, however, was grief-stricken. And he didn't take his master's death kindly. The boy had money now, and he planned on using it for something a little more...productive.<br>
<br>
Ahira studied the way the underworld worked, adjusting to all the 'rules' and allying himself with some powerful groups, ones who found slavery to be a most...unprofitable business. It took him three years, but eventually he strived to find out the location of the man who gunned down Douji. The man, by the name of Saijo Yuugure, was the one Ahira had the deepest vendetta against. Ahira hired a group of hitmen, ones who had been close to Douji, and went in a systematical order of hunting Saijo down. They murdered every single one of his co-workers, and their families, until they finally found his whereabouts in a small discreet island off of the coast of Japan. Ahira followed the trail to him and ended up murdering Saijo with his own hands.<br>
<br>
The following year, he took up one last goal, which was to end the very thing that put him in this situation. Using all the money he inherited, and the help of the allies he gained against slavery, he annihilated all of the major slave traders in the country, and effectively ended it by pouring all of his money into a plot that destroyed the very foundation of the slave market, and officially ended it. The children who were kidnapped were returned to their parents and apologies given. This was when Ahira found out something that would be...well...interesting, to say the least.<br>
<br>
He was a Librarian, overseer of the knowledge of the cosmos themselves. After about three decades of pure studying and other things revolving around his race, one of the many teachers at the Academy recruited him as the school's librarian due to his intellect and sweet personality regarding children, especially when they found him taking care of Kyouki Tohno. As well as the fact that he has a certain little secret that only he, the principal, and Kyouki are aware of....<br>

Other:<font color="Silver"><br>
Is the object of Kyouki Tohno's affection, and is aware of it.<br>
<br>
Acts as a role model for Kyouki, though it can sometimes lead to moments where he has to prevent her from trying to make their relationship...less than professional/family-like, for lack of a better term.<br>
<br>
He can be forced into his frenzy if Kyouki is harmed/threatened, as well as anyone else that is his student. His frenzy is such a violent one, that it can force Kyou into hers as well as any other Librarian that could be near him.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Name: Lurkin "Cree" Creeper<br>
Age: 27, looks 14<br>
Gender: Female<br>
Race: Ghoul<br>
Personality: Cree always seems to look as if she is entirely emotionless...which in some aspects she is. Ghouls are not raised by the same standards as other creatures, though unlike most ghouls she seems more respectful and friendly to other races. She's reletively intelegent, though not so much when it comes to social matters. Usually she prefers non-violence, but when she gets pissed.....<br>
History: Cree was taken in by her "elder sister", Alma, along with a small group of ghouls. They served as her family in a sense, though she was somewhat of an outsider since she acted more human than ghouls normally should. Eventually she left and made her way to the academy, only to run into her sister again, this time as enemies. Cree fought to protect the school and her peers on many occasions, but unfortunately during the destruction of the first building was thrown through a portal by her sister that left her stranded in a desert. Despite her grueling fear of the sun and outdoors, Cree managed to make it back to the school, only to find Alma had been impersonating her. That was the last she saw of Alma, and Cree has not gotten involved in much since.<br>

•Has a habit of singing to herself<br>
<br>
Name: Locke Foxtail<br>
Age: 16<br>
Gender: Male<br>
Race: Fox/Wolf Anthro<br>
Personality: Locke has a very unstable personality. While he can be kind and thoughtful to those he deems deserving, to others he can be ravenous, merciless and violent. He is quite cunning and strong, he was raised to be a worthy opponent in any circumstance, which he gives credit to his mother and rejects his father and his wolf heritage completely. Locke is incredibly charming and flamboyantly biWhoopi Goldbergual, appealing to men and women alike, and is even able to assume both genders dashingly.<br>
History: Locke was raised in a small village of anthromorphic beings. His mother, Plethora Foxtail, was alway a cold unfeeling woman and was incredibly strict on Locke, forcing him to live up to her ideals. Of course he was free to live up to his own Whoopi Goldbergual reputation, which from a young age he did. Locke originially enrolled in the academy as a student to reunited with his beloved, Sofya. However thier relationship ended in shambles, to the point where Locke wanted absolutely nothing to do with the girl. Shortly after the Florida trip, he left for Europe, but was called back once more to assume the duty of Director of Discipline.<br>

(I will color this eventually...)<br>
Other:<br>
•Locke enjoys crossdressing on occasion, and cares little for differences in Whoopi Goldberg claiming that gender is "only a fashion"<br>
•He is skilled at hiding objects, and often seems to pull things out of thin air<br>
•Has a hatred of Gargoyles<br>
•Wears an amulet with a cracked pink gem in it. This keeps an illusion on him so he looks human, but since the amulet is damaged his ears and tail still show.<br>
<br>
Name: Hotaru Huo<br>
Age: 86, looks 17<br>
Gender: Female<br>
Race: Inugami<br>
Personality: Hotaru is incredibly shy, nervous and apologetic. She enjoys relaxing, serene settings, but rarely gets time to enjoy peace since she's easily startled and is often dragged into trouble. A notorious crybaby, it's no difficulty driving her to tears, or getting her red in the face for that matter. Hotaru also has a dig-like side originating from her Inugami instincts, but because she was not raised by her own kind she is embarassed of this trait.

Age: 15<br>
Gender: Female<br>
Race: Sleipnir<br>
Personality: Viva is a kind gentle young woman. She tries to be kind and polite to all she meets, but can seem like kind of a goofball at times. She excells at nearly everything; sports, epidemics, etc., except she has absolutely no magical ability. Although she prefers not to fight she will whether it be in self defense or protecting others, and she is an extremely powerful, agile and swift fighter.<br>
History: Seperated from her parents by a pack of Kynokafel. she was left to wander the forests of Denmark as a little filly, only to stumble upon Lone, who took her in.<br>

History: Lone never found her place in a flock. She prefered to seduce human men and women into giving her harmless amounts of blood, while most of her kind got thier power from eating human infants. Of course this made her weaker, but she didn't seem to mind.<br>
Many years later, a young friend of her's offered her a job in America. A nice place to stay and the chance to meet cute school boys was too good to pass up, so she and her niece flew off to the Academy.<br>

It was here she formed a small clan of ghouls, who she took under her wing almost like her family. Alma originally entered TJA while working as Alice's underling. After the destruction of the first building, she left Alice and attended the school disguised as her "little sister". This charade ended when her sister returned to the school, and not much was heard about Alma since.<br>

Personality: Wren acts innocent and childish to those who don't know her, but she's genuinely devious, sneaky, and most of all a not-so-closeted pervert. Though her only intention is to be playful, she tends to cross the line often. She enjoys pulling pranks on people, especially if it involves some panchira, and is pretty open....again, she doesn't seem to have any self control on this matter. She's a loving friend, though she just can't seem to understand not everyone believes in the whole "fiends with benefits" idea.<br>
History: Born somewhere in Eurasia in the mid-11th century. As a young woman, she travelled through Europe, Asia, and even New Zealand for a while, learning about many cultures and...*coughcough* other things... She was often chased out by religious mobs as it was believed she was some sort of demon. It was sime time in the early 20th century that she hopped on a boat and ventured to America, where she wandered about from place to place, even staying at a couple yokai schools along the way before arriving at Tenshi Jigoku in present day.<br>

Age: 18<br>

He means well, but when the crazy really sets in Xerxes can get somewhat morbid and delusional. This side of him began after a terrible accident cracked his head open, and though he was able to fix himself his brain didn't heal quite right...<br>
History: Xerxes was part of an artificial race with absolute regenerating abilities. After passing all necessary scientific tests in the lab where he was created, at age 2 his biological father took him in and raised him like a normal child...though he became quite speculated *about in whichever neighborhood he moved into due to Xerxes' tendencies to fall into unfortunate circumstances. People wondered how the boy who had trips to the ER several times each year managed to miraculously survive each time unscathed. Though moving was never a problem for Xerxes' family money-wise, since the labrotory was very generous with thier payments, Xerxes' father decided it wasn't healthy for Xerxes to continue living in hiding, and since Xerxes' father was no stranger to the supernatural world he helped his son sign up for TJA.<br>

Name: Bambi<br>
Age: She was made 2 days before the school re-opened<br>
Gender: Female<br>
Race: Android<br>
Personality: Bambi was not programed with a personality. That's not to say she can't have one, she just hasn't developed much of one yet. For now she seems stoic, helpful, and a workaholic. She has a super computer for a brain, so needless to say she has great intellegence, but she knows little to nothing about deeper matters. She is extremely obidient; if she is given an objective, she will carry it out before anything else.<br>
History: During the last few days of the creation of TJA's 3rd building, the Headmaster put in a request for Whoopi Goldbergy maids. For this reason, Bambi was built, and has since been lurking around at night cleaning up after whatever damage the students may cause.<br>

Age: Sixteen<br>
Gender: Male<br>
Race: Human Witch Apprentice - Because he is an apprentice, he still needs to draw the magic seals with chalk in order to use his magical capabilities. His speciality is animating wind into cutting attacks with his halberd.  <br>
Personality: Mostly in a daze, polite to his superiors and devoted to his studies. He enjoys eating chocolate cornets on a regular basis.<br>
History: There was once a time when Ichiyu had the ambition of becoming Manga-ka, until he realised that he had no artistic talent. Being an orphan, he had thought that his parents knew he was worthless and that is why they left him. It was for this reason that he never expected to be adopted a witch named Helga who took him on as her apprentice. As the years passed, Helga grew ill and was unable to teach him, so she had him sent to the academy to further his studies.<br>

Other: Ichiyu wields a halberd with a magic seal etched all over the blade to allow him to release arcs of cutting wind when he slashes the halberd. He also carries around a box of white chalk in case he needs to draw any other seals for tasks such as moving objects. (Please note that the ability of the seal must be within the radius of the seal. This means that to animate an object such as a boulder, the seal must have a radius larger than the object itself. Seals must be drawn manually).</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Name: Koza Moloko (Thats Russian for "Goat Milk" incase you were wondering.)<br>
<br>
Age: Sixteen<br>
<br>
Gender: Male<br>
<br>
Race: Koza is an Anthropomorphic goat. <br>
<br>
Personality: Easily described as a deadpan Snarker, he has a habit of being very Satirical and Sarcastic on a regular basis. He is largely unmotivated and lazy, tending to neglect his studies. Despite this he is still a high-grade student thanks to his photographic memory. He is generally enthusiastic and rarely becomes upset over things. He also has trouble treating things seriously. Despite all this he is terrified of his superiors being upset with him. He can be seen as a comic-relief character. Oh and he's Sora, and enjoys flirting with straight boys just to be mean. But he isnt exactly feminin either, and still acts rather masculine, playing videogames and socializing with boys his age. <br>
<br>
History: Koza doesn't really have a sad back story or any kind of motivations, he was simply a student who was sent to the academy after he had shown a great potential both in battle and in intelligence. He came out of the closet a long while ago and it didn't really do any damage to his reputation. He comes from a family which are known for thier wide use of different weapons and their ability to utilize the power of a personal hammerspace in order to carry several weapons at once (Hammerspace is the notional place that things come from when they are needed, and where they go back to when not, no matter how big the storage thing is compared to the object, resulting in things like cars from a purse. There is no limit to what can be pulled out from the hammerspace).<br>

<br>
Other: Despite being really lazy, koza thouroughly enjoys battle. Though its rare for him to take his opponent seriously, when he does decide to he can be an incredibly powerful opponent. Koza has been trained in the use of several weapons by his parents (Including katana, crossbows, Bow and Arrows, all variety of fire-arms, Naginata, scythes, maces and basically every type of weapon ever.). He uses the pockets in his jumper, which leads to rather humorous situations where he pulls out a large scythe from his pocket. It should be noted that being a goat, his legs are very powerful, and he is able to outspeed even the most athletic humans. He is also a brilliant strategist, great at reading his enemies movements.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Name: Noah Dark<br>
<br>
Age: Appears to be around 17, In truth, she's only been in existence for three days.<br>
<br>
Gender: Female.<br>
<br>
Race: Clone [Heavily Altered]<br>
<br>
Personality:<br>
Noah is a very strange person, and doesn't seem to understand simple things like boundaries, or secrets. Anything she is told that she finds interesting will immediately be spread like the plague, or even burned into walls. She has no concept of hatred, and it doesn't appear she's capable of any emotion other than joy.<br>
<br>
Some find her annoying, as compared to her predecessor.<br>
<br>
History: <br>
Near the end of TJAIII, Belphegor; the God of the Observers and the fourth dimension, attempted a hostile takeover of the third dimension. Well, it wasn't so much a takeover as it was a brutal slaughter. Anyway, she realized that she didn't have enough information about the world, and sought to dispatch Zix's little toy, Norah Bright. Unfortunately, Norah was missing after the events in TJAIII. Frustrated, Belphegor had Zix use any leftover DNA from Norah to create a clone. The clone came out perfectly, and after some alterations to her physical appearance and mannerisms, Noah Dark was created. She has been sent to the Academy to do the job her predecessor failed at: Information gathering.<br>

Other: Like Bright, Dark has a strange attraction toward felines. Whether this is an intentional part of her programming is unknown. Also, she possesses a collar exactly like Bright's, to keep her under control. In the case that it is destroyed, the possibility of her running wild is very high.<br>
<br>
She has been granted the ability to manipulate fire, to ensure that she will not easily beaten, if opposed.<br>
<br>
______________<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Name: Norah Bright<br>
<br>
Age: Appears to be in her lower twenties. Her actual age is unclear, due to the strange things that have happened.<br>
<br>
Gender: Female.<br>
<br>
Race: At one time, she was merely a clone created by the Observers. However, since TJAIII, she has become even more powerful than them. Her race, however, is shown below.<br>
<br>
Personality:<br>
Norah's personality has changed considerably in the time she was missing. Unlike before, she actually gives more emotional responses. In fact, she seems to harbor a grudge against the Observers, and for the first time, she's actually showing hate for someone.<br>
<br>
History: <br>
During TJAIII, Norah was introduced as a clone, created by Zix to keep an eye on the Academy students during their trip. During that time, she didn't do very much observing of anything, instead making friends with a man named Amachi.(Was it Amachi she was with?) Eventually, she was taken back by Zix's 'brother', Nix, and transformed into a small child. The Observers planned to reprogram her during that time, but Nix took off with her, abandoning the rest. At the cost of his power as an Observer, he removed every last bit of programming in Norah, revealing to her what she truly was: the true God of the Observers. Belphegor usurped her position long ago after creating a great deal of Observers, herself. Norah's memory was wiped at the time, and she became little more than a slave. With her memory and personality restored, she seeks to dole out punishment on Belphegor and Zix.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Name: Bhalhaelo<br>
<br>
Age: She appears to be around 18 or 19, but is actually around 96; young for her kind.<br>
<br>
Gender: Female.<br>
<br>
Race: Rhornaqubh<br>
<br>
Personality: Bhalhaelo... was a quiet girl. Her speech used to be muffled by the mask she wore, but ever since she lost it, her voice has been rather clear. She comes off as a bit insane and is extremely prone to random extremes of emotion.<br>
<br>
History: Bhalhaelo has not mentioned her past, and most likely never will. She's just been around, always in the background since TJAIII. She never made it to the Florida trip, since she lost her mask earlier on. The Rhornaqubh, as mentioned before, cannot breathe Earth's air without becoming ill. However, this is not a physical illness. It's an illness of the mind; madness, to be exact. Of course, it did have physical effects, such as her hair growing out long and wild, her teeth becoming razor sharp, and her body constantly emitting enough heat to roast a turkey.<br>

<br>
Name: Zx'Vedaki/Zix<br>
<br>
Age: By third dimension time, she is around three eons old. By fourth dimension time, she's around 16.<br>
<br>
Gender: Female.<br>
<br>
Race: Observer.<br>
<br>
Personality: Zix is the same old weirdo she has been forever. She's constantly spazzing out and pulling the most random junk she can think of, and always has an enigmatic expression on her face. To most, she seems rather cheery. However, this is so far from the truth that it's almost frightening. She's always fearful of being attacked by Belphegor for screwing up a command, and thus, constantly under extreme pressure.<br>
<br>
History: Well, she's done very little. She's simply a minor Observer that decided to join Belphegor when she decided to overthrow Bright.<br>

        <div class="spoiler" style="display: none;">Name: Rt'Amaq Yuteq (Root)<br>
<br>
Age: As with the others in her race, she is much older than she appears. To give a good estimate, she's just a little older than Bright.<br>
<br>
Gender: Female.<br>
<br>
Race: 'God' (High Observer)<br>
<br>
Personality: Almost similar to Zix, Root seeks to amuse herself with everything she does. Human beings and other third dimension dwellers are little more than toys in her eyes; but they are precious toys. She loves the people of the third dimension so much that she's taken up residence there for thousands of years, just watching and mingling. She's kind to everyone, but almost everything she says is dripping with sarcasm.<br>
<br>
History: Before Bright, Belphegor and Zix were even so much as a thought, Rt'Amaq, or Root, sat alone in the fourth dimension. She had been there for as long as she could remember, just watching the early years of human life. Having very little else to do with herself, she became very attached to the people she watched, even pulling off little things to protect some of them. Her feats were called 'holy miracles' from 'God', by the humans.<br>
<br>
Root had to admit, the title of 'God' sounded pretty nice. She accepted the title, even going so far as to communicate with the humans from time to time. Eventually, she stopped talking to them, and their belief in her existence dropped. She didn't care much, but messing with them got her to wondering. If someone was able to create them, then she could certainly create her own people to play with, right?<br>
<br>
Well, forgoing the explanations of just how she managed it, Root created the Observers and passed her title down to her first creation; Bright. After that, she vanished. Unbeknownst to the other Observers, she had taken on the role of a regular human being and lived through varied eras. The Dark Ages, all to way to now. Her reasons for showing up around TJA are simple; she has yet to experience schooling in this era, and wishes to meet more third dimension dwellers; possibly even befriend them.<br>
<br>
Appearance: <img src="./106673_files/16gzm21.jpg" border="0" alt="" onload="NcodeImageResizer.createOn(this);"><br>
<br>
Other: Other Observers are required to follow what she tells them to do, though she rarely makes orders. More often than not, she words things as a request so they can have free will.</div>

Name: Lodeca Bright<br>
<br>
Age: Approx. 981 years of age, according to third dimension time.<br>
<br>
Gender: Female<br>
<br>
Race: Observer<br>
<br>
Personality: Lodeca's personality can be summed up with a simple comparison. Take Zix's personality and add in a good helping of haughtiness. Take that, and add in a blood-thirst comparable to that of a vampire's, and you have Lodeca.<br>
<br>
History: Lodeca is quite prideful of being one of the very few purple-blooded Observers, and that is one of the main reasons for her joining Belphegor’s side. In truth, she’s a double agent. Were Belphegor to ever truly gain absolute power, Lodeca plans to kill her right then and there. She wants to be the most powerful Observer there is, and even hopes to one day usurp Root’s position. That aside, Lodeca has appeared in the third dimension after receiving news of Belphegor’s defeat. What she plans to do, however, is unknown. On a side note, she is Norah's younger sister.<br>

Other: She won't allow anyone else to kill Norah. As far as she's concerned, that job is hers and hers alone. If anyone else were to even try, she would gut them like a fish. While giggling.<br>

				</div>
				<div style="font-style:italic"><div align="center">Name: <br>
Abigor Araxadign (Going by the name of 'Abby' to avoid suspicion.)<br>
<br>
Age: <br>
Her current form resembles that of a young human girl, possibly 17 or 18 years of age. However, seeing as she is one of the original Five great Observers... she's pretty damn old.<br>
<br>
Gender: <br>
Female<br>
<br>
Race: <br>
Observer; Blue-Blood.<br>
<br>
Personality: <br>
Abigor is a calm, level-headed Observer, in stark contrast to... well... all of the others. She is very slow to anger, having trained herself to restrain her emotions a long time ago. Granted, those restrained emotions sometimes have a chance of popping out at the worst possible times, causing Abigor to give in to her bloodlust.<br>
<br>
History: <br>
One of the oldest Observers still alive. Abigor was Empress Bright's right-hand when it came to matters of war. She served as a marvelous tactician during her time in service, and won Bright many, many battles. However... envy slipped into her otherwise calm mindset.<br>
<br>
<i>Why isn't it me...?</i> she always thought. She was just as old as Bright, so why was she not made the ruler? Why did the people not shout, '<i>Long live Empress Araxandign!!</i>'? she thought. Certainly, she would have made a much better empress. Surely the people would accept her... if not for Bright.<br>
<br>
All of her jealousy and negative energy gave rise to her powerful, bloodthirsty alter-ego.<br>
<br>
<b>Belphegor.</b><br>
<br>
Belphegor started out as simply a name Abigor would use to conceal her identity when necessary, but quickly evolved. Belphegor and Abigor became two different people, two separate bodies.<br>
<br>
There is a long stretch of time between Belphegor's creation and Abigor's showing up at Tenshi Jigoku Academy that remains lost to the 'sands of time', as it were.<br>

<br>
Other: <br>
Her sword is the only thing that keeps Belphegor unable to disobey her direct commands. Were she to lose it, another tragedy like what happened with Noah would occur.<br>
<br>
<br>
Name: <br>
Belphegor Araxandign<br>
<br>
Age: <br>
Unknown<br>
<br>
Gender: <br>
Female<br>
<br>
Race: <br>
Observer; Red-Blood.<br>
<br>
Personality: <br>
She is the very antithesis of Abigor, representing every last facet of her personality that she conceals.<br>
<br>
History: <br>
War, murder, unwanted caress, and genocide. All are things that make up Belphegor's incredibly bloodstained past. In fact, those things are pretty much all she's ever done. It's all she's ever <i>wanted</i> to do. She lives solely for battle, and would surely eradicate all living things in both the third and fourth dimensions, if not for Abigor's control.<br>
<br>
She has tagged along with her other half to the Academy, very much against her will.<br>

<br>
Other:<br>
I'm considering giving the Observers some elemental abilities. Norah has water, Noah had fire, and now; Belphegor has electricity. As a side note, she misses her old armor.<br>
<br>
A lot. She's also very tall, standing at exactly seven feet. Compared to Abigor's height of five feet and five inches... Belphegor's a gently caress your chest hairing giant.</div></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic"><div align="center">Name: Andhakara<br>
<br>
Age: Appearance-wise, she looks to be around twelve or so. Judging by the things she says, however....<br>
<br>
Gender: Female<br>
<br>
Race: Black-blooded Artificial Observer*(See History)<br>
<br>
Personality: To be revealed through play.<br>
<br>
History:<br>
Andhakara was not born from the power of Rt'Amaq or Norah like the rest of the Observers. She was created in a lab from the body of a recently deceased blue-blood, the heart of a red-blood, and gallons upon gallons of black-blood. At the time of her creation, simply living was painful. She couldn't move one step without falling apart, unable to maintain her form. She would periodically melt into nothingness for days or weeks at a time, so pained that she wanted to scream...<br>
<br>
<i>But she had no mouth to do so with...</i><br>
<br>
Eventually, she gained enough power to hold herself together. At that time, all hell broke loose. She began devouring other Observers at random, her hunger overtaking her sense. She was soundly defeated by her creator and forbidden to devour life.<br>
<br>
Following the example set by the other Observers, she has come to Tenshi Jigoku Academy not to learn, not to observe, but to <i>eat</i>.<br>

<br>
Other:<br>
<br>
Andhakara's powers are complicated, so they will be listed here in full.<br>
<br>
Let's start with her tentacles. She can create up to six at a time, each able to stretch outward from her body by exactly five meters at a time. The only harmful thing about them is that they have incredible strength. That... and the fact that each one has a little mouth at the tip that is used for sucking the life out of Andhakara's prey. These can easily be stopped by applying pressure to them, as this causes Andhakara great pain.<br>
<br>
Next, let's talk about her 'snack time'. This essentially works on the same limitations as the tentacles, only able to be created six meters away from her body at a time. 'Snack time' is her name for a great pool of black blood she is able to create, that will swallow up those unfortunate enough to step into it. The simplest way to avoid it is to just not step in it, since it's more of a highly visible trap than anything else.<br>
<br>
Lastly, her ability to break herself down. Being largely made up of black blood, Andhakara is more than capable of melting herself down into nothing more than a puddle to avoid damage or to sneak past things. When hit directly with a physical sort of attack, her body will open up at the site of impact and absorb the object used to strike her.<br>
<br>
... I think that's about it, so I'll just leave this here.</div></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic"><div align="center">Name: Olzsiactho No'alellelosh<br>
<br>
Age: Appears similar to a human 17-18 year old girl. True age is unknown.<br>
<br>
Gender: Officially, Olzsiactho is an 'it'. However, it uses a female form to blend in with humanoids.<br>
<br>
Race: Eldritch Abomination similar to the Rhornaqubh, race name unknown. <br>
<br>
Personality: wjkhgfwoihd You know I don't bother with this line.<br>
<br>
History:<br>
<br>
In the beginning, there was darkness. This fact has absolutely nothing to do with Olzsiactho unless you consider the second darkness, the darkness that the whole of Yon-Jigen. When the darkness was dispersed, even Root herself could not completely destroy it. She simply moved it elsewhere in hopes that it would not cause problems.<br>
<br>
It didn't, for quite some time. The darkness moved from place to place within Yon-Jigen and the third dimension, collecting up the thoughts of many. It was with those thoughts that Olzsciactho created a form for itself, based upon what many within both worlds considered to be 'monstrous'. However, it found the reactions given by others confusing. In Yon-Jigen, it was actually attacked, rather than bowed down to as it had hoped.<br>
<br>
In the third dimension, it was treated as though it was Death. People ran, again not bowing down. Olzsciactho was very, very confused. So, it resolved to learn more about the two worlds, starting with Yon-Jigen.<br>
<br>
After slaughtering a Rhornaqubh girl and stealing her appearance, name, and life, Olzsciactho (under the guise of Iqugognaboa <font size="1">"Iku" for short</font>) lived the life any Rhornaqubh could expect...<br>
<br>
... and hated it. So, it followed another Rhornaqubh to the third dimension and has been wandering the outer walls of Tenshi Jigoku Academy for about... a day and a half.<br>

Well... immortal may not be perfectly correct. Iori can die, but she'll be completely fine in the morning. This, of course, means that she has no sense of fear, knowing that nothing can put her down permanently.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic"><b>Name:</b> Zircon<br>
<b>Age:</b> Unknown but looks 17<br>
<b>Gender:</b> Male<br>
<b>Race:</b> Genie<br>
<b>Personality:</b> Sometimes a bit stubborn and spoiled, Zircon acts like a prince and does not know the meaning of being moderated. If he feels like walking around the place covered in expensive clothes and jewelry or sitting in a throne made of shinny crystals right in the middle of class he will do so. Extravagant in some ways and a gentleman to all females in general he seems to be kindhearted to everyone though he does not act as nicely when he is left around males and instead of a warming smile his expression will be of boredom and a somewhat annoyance.<br>
<b>History:</b> Zircon was enslaved for a very long time and forced to serve his masters trow generations. Coincidence or not all of those who took possession of him were ambitious men that wouldn't care about the cost of their actions as long as they got what they desired. One day a spell gone wrong and a master who betrayed him made him fall into a deep sleep and be sealed inside a crystal. <br>
The man who currently was holding him after realizing he was sealed deemed him useless and threw the crystal away. Several generations passed and one day a old women working in her field found the crystal buried. She took it and cleaned it and accidentally awoke the young looking Genie from his sleep. As a Genie Zircon immediately asked his now new master what her wish was but the old lady just smiled and said she had no wishes. "I may live in a small house and live a poor life. But i am happy and healthy and besides i am already too old to wish for anything. I came here to live my final days in peace and that is exactly what i got. I consider myself lucky that my sons and grandchildren have stable and honest lives. So there is nothing else for me to wish for." The young Genie seemed surprised with her words but he insisted once more that she should at least make one wish so he could repay her for awakening him from his long sleep. So the old lady made her wish and surprised the Genie once more. <br>
"Then i wish you keep me company on my remaining days and once i die you shall be free."  Freedom...how many masters as he had ever since he became a full fledged Genie and non of them had ever even cared about his well being? He even ended up sealed because one of his masters had force him to break a rule. But the wish of that old lady made him happy he had been born a Genie for the very first time. <br>
Needless is to say he gladly granted her wish and once the old lady passed away he left the place and traveled a long way to get into TJA. If there was a place where he could look for a fresh start and a way to learn how to live free it had to be there.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Name: Xirea (pronunciation: Zeer-Ah)<br>
<br>
Age: 17<br>
<br>
Gender: male, with mostly female spiders<br>
<br>
Race: Sub-Human, Arachnomancer <br>
<br>
Personality: Xirea is deceitful, mischievous, and a tad mentally unstable, he keeps up appearances during classes, and seamlessly blends in with the normal human student crowd, yet manipulates the school from the shadows with an army of spiders, and a web of unspeakable, eight-legged, horror! He also seems to get off on striking fear into the hearts of humans and creatures of all kind. <br>
<br>
History:Xirea endured agonizing and gruesome arachnomancer training at an early age, including an entrance ceremony, where in order to continue to climb up the ranks and sharpen his arachnomancing skills, Xirea was made to renounce his human name, then kill and eat his human mother as spiders do. Ever since that day Xirea hasn't been quite right in the head. By the time he was 15 years old Xirea's skills had greatly surpassed the other arachnomancers in his coven, and maybe even the spider queen herself. It was for this reason Xirea was exiled from the coven; for he had accumulated the loyalties of every spider, leaving none for anybody else. His tremendous skills also made the other arachnomancers look bad in general by comparison.<br>

<br>
Other: When killing and torturing his prey, in addition to using swarms of deadly spiders, spider based black magic, and many concealed blades, Xirea will occasionally use special bred spiders to give his victims nightmares, bad luck, sickness, and vivid horrific hallucinations. <br>
Xirea also has an abnormally strong hatred for anything that is bright orange in color, and his lips don't move to match his words when he talks.</div>

Personality: Romano is a master con artist and a charmer, he constantly uses his unique abilities for his own self gratification. He acts very civil and polite, avoids getting involved in the quarrels of others, keeps a low profile for the most part, yet not without a certain eloquence. He hides his true nature and intentions behind a gentle, proper, and kind hearted facade; always being ever so careful as to never lose his composure, not even for a single moment!<br>

        <div class="spoiler" style="display: none;"><font size="4">Somewhere in central Italy, a very long time ago, the story begins with a lonely swan. Very far from home, famished, and desperate it came across the witch trials latest victim. In order to keep from starving to death the swan reluctantly poked around the piles of ash for something to eatable. It was that day, the swan's life was changed forever when it unknowingly consumed the char covered heart of a recently deceased witch. After its horrid meal the swan fell into a deep sleep, in it's slumber the magic of the witch's had turned the swan into a beautiful young maiden. The world of the humans seamed so marvelous, however, little did she know that this new and exiting world would just as treacherous and cruel as the one she had came from. It was not long at all before the inexperienced swan had fallen hopelessly in love with a human boy and gotten herself pregnant. In a tragic twist of fate, as she passed the baby it took with it, all the witch's magic. As the magic left her body she began to revert back into a lowly bird, the swan's pelvis was shattered, it's insides crushed by the newborn. Her lover watched in disgust as the bird gave birth to his child, realizing the great mistake he had made, he cursed the swan and begged for forgiveness from the lord. In her last breath, the swan pleaded for the safety of her child, and then her lover cut her throat out with a butchers knife. The father held the deformed child in his arms for the first time, he had planned to murder it and atone for his sin, but when he touched the newborn, the mother's dieing wish came to life in the form of a protection enchantment. The man began to feel tipsy, he found that he was suddenly having great difficulty keeping his balance and fell down to the ground, landing on the bloody butcher's knife. The baby was found covered in blood the next morning and was placed in an orphanage. The head nun that oversaw said orphanage, was a recovering alcoholic. Upon realization of the enchantment placed on the child, the wicked old nun adopted him, and would frequently touch the child in inappropriate places in order to simulate the feeling of being drunk. In the year or so the baby was in her care, the filthy old hag would get drunk on the magic three or four times a day. When she was found out and brought to the pope to answer for her sins, the child was taken away from her, and she was thrown out of the church. The nun had gotten drunk off the child so much over corse of the last year, she could no longer live without it, she was running a high fever. The following night she attempted to break into the orphanage to steal back the sleeping toddler, but after going twenty-four hours without abusing the power of the child, after doing it so often, the vile nun burst into flames from the inside, and was reduced to a pile of ash at the foot of the child's crib. After becoming heavily associated with mysterious deaths, it was widely believed the child was possessed by the devil, so no one in the area ever attempted to adopt him after that. As the child grew up in the orphanage, it seemed that it didn't quite age like other children. After living at the orphanage for thirty entire years, the child still only appeared to be eight or nine years old. The child was regarded as an abomination and a demon, he had silver hair like a demon and was always up to no good. He would convince the other children to bring him things, do things to themselves, and get themselves into trouble with the nuns, it was all very amusing to the boy. On multiple occasions the towns people formed a mob and attempted to burn the boy alive, but whenever they'd get to his room, he seemed to talk their anger and fears right out of them, and the mob was disbanded. One day the boy finally decided to leave the orphanage of his own free will, he met no objection with his request, and it's rumored they rejoiced and held some sort of celebration once he had left. The people at the orphanage had always referred to him as a thing, or a monster, he had never even received a name, so the day he left he decided from that day on, that he would be known as Romano Cigno. The following years Romano traveled from city to city using his cute, childlike outer appearance and abilities to get whatever he wanted and trick unsuspecting women into taking their clothes off. It worked out great until his body finally began to hit puberty and none of his old tricks would work anymore.Romano*fell into a deep state of depression, as the success rates of his previously irresistible tricks continued to plummet, while his attraction and appreciation for the beauty of the opposite Whoopi Goldberg only grew stronger and more unbearable. It was then that Romano abandoned his old ways, and devoted a decade of his life to learning everything there is to know about high class society, the arts, and being a perfect gentlemen. He did this all in preparation for the day when his body had finally aged enough for him to put his new found abilities to the test! He would get all the ladies now, just like he had before! The day had finally came! His body had finally aged enough and had reached the outer appearance of a sixteen year old! That night Romano partied heavily with many exotic women, for tomorrow he would leave his life long home of Italy and start a new adventure at Tenshi Jigoku Academy!</font></div>

<br>
Other: Romano has persuasive capabilities and charm that defies reason. Large amounts of intense, direct, eye contact, or any amount of physical contact with Romano may result in: Mild to severe symptoms of intoxication, Acute drowsiness, Impaired judgment, and an accelerated Heart beat. Some students may feel these effects more drastic then others...<br>

The powerful magic enchantment that was placed on Romano is a protective enchantment by nature, although the caster(his mother) had tremendous magical power at the time she cast it, she wasn't experienced in using the powers, nor did she even know she had them. The result of this was the amateur casting of a powerful an unbreakable protective enchantment, that granted completely random different protections. The protections Romano got from the enchantment and the magic swan blood he got from his mom is where he gets his “Powers” from. Over the years Romano has gained the ability to manipulate his contact intoxication protection rather effectively it is perhaps his most valuable tool, he's even managed to figure out how to switch it off, but he almost always keeps it turned on. Romano's second protection ability he hasn't fully mastered yet, it subdivides into two different powers. The first power of the camouflage protection makes it so his appearance  is shifted slightly by every human or creature who see's, the original purpose of this was to make it so he was seen exactly as he is but with a sort of aurora that would always make him seem less intimidating to that person. Combining the camouflage with the disorientation of his contact intoxication protection only made him seem less and less intimidating the more disorientated the target was. Romano eventually found a way to use this power as well, to satisfy his own perversions, for he eventually discovered how to use it to make others all view him as slightly more attractive, instead of slightly less intimidating. (He's not horrible or deformed looking without using the power.) Now when he uses the disorientation it makes him seem more and more like the targets personal preference/definition of attractiveness, the longer he uses it; it even makes the things he's saying sound more attractive. (If your directly in contact with him long enough, he can basically call you a smelly sweetheart and you'll hear it as the man of your dreams passionately reciting you poetry.) <i><font color="white"><u>For example, If one of Roo's characters was in contact with Romano for an extended period of time, Romano's appearance would change to the point where he could possibly wind up looking something like this... </u><br>

The second power of the camouflage is much more difficult to use, it allows him to make curtain objects appear to be different objects to ALL of a person or creatures seances. (even the 6th) The part that makes this power difficult to use is that Romano has only ever had success using it on small objects and things that he's either touching with his hands, carrying with him on his person, or wearing as clothing. Also every bodies seances perceive the object he's camouflaging different. A common example of this is Romano's gun, it's always in his suit jackets exterior front pocket, or somewhere in his outfit but anybody who looks at it, or tries to smell or touch it wile it's still on his person will perceive it as whatever flower they like the best and/or think is most beautiful. If Romano is too flashy about how he uses it in public, people and/or creatures sharing their different opinions about what their seeing can get him into some trouble. Like pretty much all of Romano's powers, it becomes far more effective in close proximity if he has some sort of contact intoxication disorientation going; he can make people perceive through all their seances that they are suddenly in their perfect dream world, and everything around you is everything you ever wanted it to be, the impaired judgement that comes with the disorientation will prevent them from ever questioning how, or why, or anything! The protection Enchantment Romano's mother put all her magic into before she died, grants him many spectacular abilities. Most of the magic was originally harmless and only ever intended for protection, it is only because of a single protection, that Romano was so incredibly lucky to randomly acquire from the enchantment, that allowed him to gain so much control over the magic; this protection being the protection against the passage of time. It is only because Romano acquired this legendary power, making him age so incredibly slow, that he was able to gain the miniscule fraction of control he has achieved. To ever even hope to achieve partial control over such a chaotic, and amateurishly casted enchantment, it would require many lifetimes worth of experience; which Romano was so fortunately granted. Over the corse of Romano's time on this earth, he's developed an immunity to the majority of all known diseases, both major and minor; so the only way for him to really die is to be killed by someone or die of old age after several centuries; which bring this colossal rant to Romano's final and most dangerous protection. The spirit of Romano's mother watches over him always, for all the tragedy and hardship she was forced to endure in life, she was granted the wings of an angel in death. This final protection was eluded to several times in the backstory, it makes it so that humans and creatures, overflowing with evil and sin, who attempt to take Romano's life or abuse him for his enchantment, suffer horribly, horribly, horribly, bad luck, which has in the past resulted in the occurrence of one-in-a-million chains of improbable events when the aggressor winds up dieing in the middle of the act somehow. Although this section is very, very, very, long; Romano really isn't all that dangerous or powerful. Romano is really a lover, not a fighter. The majority of Romano's magical abilities he really only knows how to use for protective, seductive, and persuasive, purposes. If SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER happen to occur and Romano transformed into his true form, nearly all his regular powers would no longer work, except for his minor powers of SPOILER, which would increase a thousand fold... If that did happen he'd also gain the new ability to SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER... But unless all that happens... Romano is pretty much completely useless in a fight, he would get his ass kicked if he got into a fight at TGA4, even against curtain human students! Which is why perhaps Romano's most useful attribute is his ability to talk and charm his way out of fighting.<br>

<br>
Name: Dallaque<br>
<br>
Age: Not a smart question to ask her... She shifts forms a lot, in her human form she appears to be about 17 or 18, she periodically changes it to give the illusion that its actually aging regularly, but she only does this so that it always appears that she's about the same age as her current familiar, Xirea. She can basically take a human form of any age she wants, at anytime. In her spider form she's grown to a size far larger then any normal black widow spider could. Her true form she cannot change the age of at will, it's apparent looks about 14 years old, which means she's been alive for at least four-hundred years, still rather young compared to the length of the spider queen's lifespan...<br>

Personality: Dallaque pretty much just sits around reading, eating, and playing video games all day and night, and takes nice long naps in Xirea's mouth. She's very direct, easy to amuse, tire, anger, make jealous, and so forth... She essentially acts whatever age she feels like being, and can even act as a voice of reason, but only in the company of such reasonless individuals as Xirea... With Xirea and Dallaque ones always the bossy, sadistic, hard-ass adult and the other is always the insane, oblivious, mass murdering little kid... Xirea usually plays both parts wile Dallaque watches... <br>

I can honestly say that...<br>
1.) I could fill a series of eight 200+ page novels with just her backstory.<br>
2.) None of it is at all relevant to the main story nor is it essential to her character.<br>
3.) Xirea's post's have already provided a sufficient background for the Spider Queen, prior to my posting this.<br>
4.) One of the only people on here that actually reads the entire backstories I write is Roo, and if it read the spider queen's backstory, it would likely be spider overdosed and ready to murder me after the first paragraph! <br>
5.) If I attempted to compress all that information into a single post, heads would literally explode from all the information!</div>

<br>
Other: Dallaque, is not a student, even though she could easily fit the description, a hell of a lot better then Xirea does at least. Dallaque, is also not a teacher, even though she knows more then enough about most subjects to teach them effortlessly, at a college grade level. Dallaque is a Spider queen, she's supposedly “OVER 9,000” times better at arachnomancing then Xirea, yet you never see her lift a finger. The soul reason that Xirea is attending TJA4 this year, (until he gets kicked out or murdered horribly), is because Dallaque filled out all the paperwork for him to attend and convinced him to go, just she could lounge around all day and night in a nice room, without ever actually having to attend a single class. She's basically just a lazy freeloader...</div>

Of all the slayers there was none that hated the abominations more than Ashcroft did, nor was their any better at killing them then he. Alfred, being the son of two slayers, was destined to continue on his family legacy and had been diligently studying since he was young. When Alfred was about nine years of age his mother was killed in the line of duty. His father, devastated by the loss of his wife, stepped down from The Order of Slayers, in pursuit of a less dangerous, more family oriented life. When Alfred herd that his mother had been killed he was devastated, it was at that moment that he declared war against all creatures, he had loved hearing stories about them as a child, but now, he vowed t slay every last one of them. Alfred's beloved father inwich he used to idolize and respect, became dead to the boy. Alfred, filled with hate for his father for dropping out of The Order, filled out extensive and complex paperwork to have his father striped of his titles, name, and position as head of the family. The boy cast his grief stricken father out into the streets and began working full time as a slayer at the age of eleven years old. Alfred was very successful in The Order, in his first five years slaying he built up quite a reputation and was awarded more honors and titles then either of his parents ever had. To Alfred's great dismay the other slayers at the order took to calling him “Grimlip” on account of the peculiar scowl the boy had acquired. There was a girl in town that Ashcroft was rather found of, she was a childhood friend of his  from the days before he became a slayer. Ashcroft would visit her at the flower shop from time to time as a way of escaping from the pressures of being a slayer. Ashcroft knew his friend was always up early to open the shop, and once after a long night of slaying vampires Ashcroft made the fatal mistake of going to see her before the sun had fully risen. The following night vengeful bloodsuckers descended and took the girl from her home in an attempt to bait Ashcroft into his demise. Ashcroft mercilessly slaughtered every last vampire in their group by himself, using an oversized silver broadsword and the Order's early attempt at a shotgun. By the time he had rescued the girl and held her in his arms again, Ashcroft realized that he was to late. Ashcroft stared into the cold, undead eyes of the only girl he had ever loved beside his mother, and with a sigh and a bang, he shot a giant hole through her head. Alfred felt the rapid beat of his heart start to slow, as his sword became more and more painful to hold on to. Alfred quickly sterilized the wound from where she bit him and injected several pints of a franticly concocted anti-venom into his chest with the silver needle and supplies he brought along in his slayer emergency kit. Ashcroft was able to stop the transformation in its tracks and fend off the advances of vampracy, through daily anti-venom regiments and rest. Although Alfred could walk in the sunlight and wield his silver weapons again after a month or so, feelings of deep hatred, self loathing, and guilt resurfaced in him. He was constantly reminded of these feelings every time he looked in the mirror, for his eyes no longer resembled his mother's, they had lost their soft, gentle, luster, now they radiated with the same cold, inhuman, presence as the monsters'. It was around the time of this incident that the warm, youthful, and cheery,  expression, Alfred used to walk about with, was replaced with the awkward, and uncomfortable, scowl, of the slayer with the single dwarf vampire fang, that inspired the nick name “Grimlip.” With Ashcroft's now slightly above human speed, strength, and sight combined with his textbook knowledge, and superior skills, he went on to surpass all the other slayers, and accumulate a reputation that struck fear into the hearts of even the most treacherous of teddy bears. Ashcroft was in the process of bringing down a powerful coven of witches, The Order of Slayers had been doing battle with this particular coven for centuries with little to no significant progress before the assignment was handed down to Ashcroft. Upon taking on the task Ashcroft had managed to slay a great number of their wicked brew. The coven was in a state of complete disarray, for never had their been such a real threat that even their most well hidden, skilled, and high ranking, sisters could be slain in the night. The coven was getting desperate, as the head witches started to go into hiding. Alfred had managed to track down one of their most elite sisters to her lair, she had fled to italy and forged. When Alfred confronted her she froze up in a state of disbelief that The Order possessed a slayer resourceful enough to track her to Italy, powerful enough to defeat her, determined, and confident enough in his ability to slay her, to make the long voyage all by himself without any magic. Had the order such a valuable weapon in it's possession, surely they'd never let it leave the safety of England just to chase after a single witch, right? These were the last thoughts that passed through the women's head as she was burned at the steak. Alfred was just about to begin the unpleasant task of disposing of the witch's charred remains, when he noticed a bone white bird lingering around. Contrary to popular belief and seemingly in spite of everything that's already been mentioned about Ashcroft's character thus far in this ridiculous, unnecessarily long, back story; Ashcroft, with all his self loathing and hatred of magic/magical creatures, has a inexplicable sort of weakness for small animals. Without stopping to clean up the witches remains first or wonder why/how the hell a swan would be walking the streets of Italy, Alfred runs off with his super-human speed in the direction of a market he had passed pursuing the witch, in order to get something for the scrawny little swan to snack on. By the time Alfred had returned to the burnt up pile of witch, the swan had already departed and the locals had started to get frantic as to what the hell was going on with this mysterious, fast running, women burning, foreigner. Realizing that the geographically incorrect bird had already waddled away, and that he had overstayed his welcome, the slayer let out a quiet sigh and proceeded to scoop up the remnants of the witches crispy corpse. Upon his return, Ashcroft was honored as The Order of Slayers' greatest agent, and as a valiant defender of justice and humanity. It was on that evening that grand festivities were held for Ashcroft, for the following day he would charge in to battle and bring down the rest of the, now severely weekend and vulnerable, coven of witches. It took a wile for Alfred to emotionally recover from all the tragedies and horrors he had gone through over the years, but he had finally done it, Alfred was finally happy with his life again. Alfred was proud to be a slayer, to be blessed with the strength to protect the good people of london, and honor his mother's memory. Before heading into battle Alfred made amends with his father and the other slayers and promised to come back alive. The coven knew that Ashcroft was headed to Spider Country to slaughter them, and that none of them individually had enough power to stop the slayer. In an effort to buy more time the coven pooled all their magic together h a single spell to freeze the slayer in time. When Ashcroft did not return The Order assumed the worst, fearing they may have gravely underestimated the witch coven, formal diplomatic relations were extended to the coven. The Order feared the witchs' potential, they believed they were powerful enough to defeat their greatest slayer, and so they were more then generous in negotiating an armistice. In the centuries that followed diplomatic relations improved between the human and magical communities and The Order Of Slayers changed over time into a sort of 'magical police force,' Only slaying “Pure Evil” and dangerous creatures; opposed to their old stance of purging and nondiscriminatory monster genocide. When Alfred was finally free from the spell, he awoke to a world that no longer shared his hatred. The slayer found himself in the center of the witch coven's den, his frozen body had been kept a secret and locked away in a magical vault for all that time; for the premise of the peace negotiations was that  The Order of Slayers believed the witches possessed the power to kill Ashcroft. The slayer was agitated, and more then well rested, he quickly ravaged his way though the magic jail cell that he found himself in. Ashcroft slaughtered and burned every single witch in the coven, regardless of the massive increase in size and strength of the coven that had occurred over the years. Ashcroft helped himself to a meal in the dead witchs' kitchen,  and salvaged a few interesting items from the den before embarking on his journey home. The slayer was eager to return to London and tell his friends and family of his momentous triumph. Traveling back through spider country, there were far less arachnids then Ashcroft remembered, it was if they had all just left for some reason... ( They All Followed Xirea to TJA4!!! &gt;:} ) When Alfred finally returned to The Order Of Slayers and discovered how long he had been gone for, and how different the world was, especially regarding the relationship between humans and monsters, he was outraged! The old Order would have showered him with honor, titles, and gold for taking for finally taking down that entire coven of witches singlehandedly! The Order had spent centuries trying to kill those damn witches, before Ashcroft was even admitted! Instead of legendary praise and recognition of a job well done, the new,o more humane Order or Slayers, reprimanded Ashcroft, revoked his slaying license, and required that he attend classes at a magic integrated school and learn to be more tolerant, if he ever wanted to wield so much as a silver butter knife ever again. Ashcroft furiously agreed, promising that once he's finished at TJA4 he's going to assume control of The Order of Slayers, as it's most senior and decorated member, and restore it to it's former glory! </div>

        <div class="spoiler" style="display: none;">Alfred wields Gladius Divus; A legendary broadsword crafted from various alchemically enhanced metals and the horns of unicorns. Gladius Divus in the past was The Order of Slayers greatest weapon. The sword was passed down for centuries, deemed the soul property of “He who breaths and is the greatest slayer to draw earthly breath.” When Alfred went to concur the witchs' coven, he was given the fabled blade, to assist in his quest, he still bears it today. The current Order of Slayers lacks the authority to strip the legendary sword from him, for the only two ways for the sword to be transferred from one slayer to another is for the slayer currently in possession of it to either acknowledge another slayer as superior and give it up to them willingly, or for the current holder of the sword to be defeated in a duel by another. The new Order's best champions all suffered humiliating defeat against Alfred, when they tried dueling him for the sword, and so the slayer managed to successfully prove his right to wield Gladius Divus is fabled to have been infused with the halos of a thousand vengeful angels. In addition to the broadsword, Alfred also has a special pendant he always wears around his neck that protects him from magic spells, enchantments, and curses. Alfred found the pendant in the witchs' coven after the fight, having seen an etching of it in an old book once before, he instantly knew what it was, and decided to take it back to The Order. After learning of the powerful spell that had taken his old life and time from him, Alfred fasten the pendant on his neck, and has no taken it off once since that day. Also, another detail of dire semi-importance; whenever Alfred see's a tulip, and whenever flowers come up in conversation, he starts acting super emo.</div>

    <div>
        <div class="spoiler" style="display: none;">Buratta was the demented hybrid species offspring of inbreeding carnies enslaved at a freak show. The ringmaster in charge had a shriveled old husk of a heart that knew only greed, he was always breeding his top sub-human freaks together to produce new side shows that to draw in more money. Buratta's parents were a brother and sister pair of sub-humans cast out and labeled abominations, sold to the ringmaster at an early age. The boy was a gargoyle, the girl was some sort of human porcupine hybrid, both had magical abnormalities the ring master made quite a pretty penny exploiting over the years. Never satisfied, the wicked ring master forced the two siblings to produce offspring together once they had began to age past their primes; the resulting monstrosity was Buratta. The child's skin was more dense then even his father's stone body, it took hours with a hack saw to remove the umbilical cord. To the ringmaster's great dismay, the child was not born with the stone wings of gargoyle, nor did it have the tail or razor sharp quills of it's mother. Buratta's abilities left a lot to be desired, the ringmaster struggled to find a useful place for the boy in the act. Giving birth to the useless child had made one of the show's star attractions too weak and brittle to preform her act, and the boy himself lacked the freakish characteristics to properly preform either his parents acts. The child’s appearance was far too ordinary to be that of the spawn of two of the star attraction sub-human freaks, his quill needles were heavy and dull like tiny stones, they were hardly noticeable and shot to quickly for the crowd to observe. The boy could jump up to twenty feet in the air but he couldn't sustain flight without any wings, and the impact of his inhumanly heavy body crashing against the ground would utterly destroy it; creating massive craters in the earth and generating shock waves that always gave a handful of audience members fatal heart attacks. The child grew to be largely hated and feared by the audience for the ringmaster's failed attempts to properly display his unique abilities. Unable to find a way to draw in money with his new sideshow act, the ringmaster eventually attempted an act of setting the child on fire, in order to please the audience. This new act was seen as appalling, Buratta looked to much like a normal human boy, those viewing the show with a shred of human morality were outraged and disgusted, some even demanded refunds. The sick, twisted, and and criminally deranged portions of the audience were not entertained by the spectacle either. Although Buratta must of have been in excruciating pain the whole time, being burned alive all those times, the boy let out no horrible shrieks of pain, he just sat there smiling in a state of silent bliss as the embers danced along his skin, his flesh unfazed by the heat of the flames; this deprived the audience of any sort of sadistic thrill. The ringmaster, realizing how worthless Buratta was as an act, sold him without hesitation when presented with a more then generous offer from an anonymous party. It was after being sold to aNex (A top secret military faction specializing in sub-human weapon technology) that Buratta was subjected to numerous genetic experimentations, and re-engineered to be a super human weapon. At the age of 13, when the four years period of all the initial testing, training, and alterations had finally been concluded, it was first starting out in the field that Buratta found his true love; The Bazooka. Using his new powers and weapons, it wasn't long before Buratta went rouge and went on a murderous rampage, inwich he killed everyone of his handlers, every scientist that worked on his project, the ringmaster, and a lot of the freaks that irritated or abused him over the years. After the massacre Buratta willing gave himself up to authorities in exchange for multiple pardons, full reinstatement, an elaborate cover-up that would take all the blame and consequences of his actions off his shoulders, and some very comfortable living arrangements. Buratta's project was disbanded, do to it's destructive instability and  slaughter of nearly everyone working on it. Three years later the project was reformed under new management and Buratta was pulled from his maximum security military detention center/luxurious private mansion 300 miles below sea level, to be reactivated. Buratta had made great improvement during his three years underground, and had grown into a some-what sensible young man, however he was not thrilled to hear he would first need to receive additional schooling before he could return to full active duty. Buratta reluctantly agreed to the more then gracious offer, provided he got to pick which school he attended. Buratta then proceeded to illegally fax his top secret file out to every academy his handlers offered him as a suitable option. Buratta then declared; “I pick whatever academy on this list that thinks it's got the balls to accept me as a student, knowing all the hell that follows me around.” Of the thousands of approved academies on the list, only one of them would touch Buratta after reviewing the file...</div>

<br>
Power Synopsis: Buratta's birth given powers, combined with all the experimentation and add-ons basically make him a walking gun/artillery factory, with a strong animal instinct, and skin that burns incredibly slowly and is more dense then the exterior of a tank. <br>

				<div style="font-style:italic"><b>Name:</b> Clause Arkwright<br>
<b>Age:</b> 17<br>
<b>Gender:</b> Male<br>
<b>Race:</b> Half human / Half phantom breed<br>
<b>Abilities:</b><br>
<br>
<u><i>Race:</i></u> Clause comes from an very rare breed, <i>the half phantoms</i>; in this strange combination, the human half and phantom half exist in physically separate bodies, but are always close by one another.<br>
The blue sphere of energy or rather; <i>phantom</i>, is a manifestation of energy and solely energy alone. This phantom has so much capacity, which made it able to hold up so much energy, that in time and growth gave it a own mind of its own. It's another deity that acts as a partner for Clause either in battle or in his casual life. <br>
<br>
This strange breed comes from an pact that is made with this deity of energy, which Clause has swore his life, mind and body for. The ritual combines the two beings and makes them one, in a manner of speaking. The energy that the phantom posseses can be manifested by Clause at will and then animated into an object of pure energy and using that as means of fighting, creating an whole new and original fighting style.<br>
<br>
<i><u>Poltergeist Manifestation: </u></i> By Drawing energy from the phantom, Clause 'clays' this energy into objects that he can use to fight with.<i> His preference is imitating real life weapons such as swords or halberds, whatever he is able to, prefering close range combat</i>. A phantom draws energy of nature itself and in time will regain any energy which it ever lost. Quantity with that will be no problem, as long as Clause doesn't overuse this energy and drain too much of the phantom.<br>
<br>
<i><u>Yuumuu's GhostBlade: </u></i>Draws energy and by simple means 'clays' it into a sword of solely pure energy of the phantom. Resembles much like a cross of blue energy than a sword , but a sword to slice regardless.<br>
<br>
<i><u>Exghostskeleton: </u></i><br>
By covering himself in this energy he can coat himself to protect from incoming attacks. Strengthening him and reducing the damage sustained otherwhise. He can also apply this to certain parts of his body only, like for example his fist, which when empowered by this skeleton can deal heavy damage, it could easily destroy a huge boulder with no more then 3 hits or so.<br>
Or his feet to be able to apply more strength to that body part when he pushes himself from the ground, making him able to reach speeds as four times as fast as he normally would be.<br>
<br>
<i><u>Ghostly Gardener: </u></i> By making multiple <i>Yuumuu's Ghostblades</i> and summoning them from they sky they catter around the battlefield covering the scenery with countless of energy swords. Immediately after this event he uses Exghostskeleton and applies that energy to his feet to be able to reach high speeds. He picks up any swords he encouters and picks them up trying to slice his enemy with those swords, ocassionally picking up multiple swords or discarding them to confuse his enemy or initiate combos to deal even more damage. <i>This is more of an special move created by Clause then an real ability.</i> Also do note that the amount of swords created here takes alot of energy, so to make up for that the sword hold less energy that they normally do, reducing their durability.<br>
<br>
<i><u>Hallucinate: </u></i> This move/ability is an special one known only by Clause and also created by himself. This move is called hallucinate, simply because it is used to confuse his enemy, or so meant to. Clause creates immediate clones or perfect recreations of himself through energy and uses these for combat. Now you don't want anyone to be able to summon a whole army of energy shooting zombies here so here's the deal; These energy clones are created and created with an task. Let jusy say he creates a clone to go and hit that deadly bunny right in front of him, created for this task and controlled by will the clone will do so but dissapears when finished the task. So these clones aren't permanent when created by Clause, which makes it not able to do great thins, but do have the ability to make for fast-paced combat. When creating multiple of them at a time they can confuse the enemy and/or hit them multiple times when you would actually be hitting them once. The clones are also able to use any minor techniques Clause knows, but this would require even more energy, taking note that creating clones already costs quite some.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Personality:</b><br>
Clause is quite a headstrong guy. Always only thinking from his own perspective and loudmouthing his opinions on different matters. He most of the times, forces his opinion on others forgetting the rest of the world around him, almost completely, sometimes. The most remarkable or annyoing trait about him is that he always forgets to include other peoples feelings in certain situations. So making it seems like he only thinks about himself, while in reality this happens totally unintentionally. Automatically making him hated by some people as they tend to avoid him because of this personality. He is proud if his original country and culture and won't tolerate any discrimination or racism towards anyone. Not even someone else. He had experienced it first hand so it is a matter that lies emotional.<br>
<br>
<b>History:</b><br>
At the age of 12, Clause always wondered to himself what actually the difference was with his family, regarding his phantom. His Father was one of the most feared and respected man in the area, not to forget the political influence the man had. Even Clause himself, his son was forced to bow and establish a relationship something further away then you could call one of a family. And despite all that, even his father was ocassionally seen bowing towards the phantom. And that wasn´t even the strange part, this phantom was the only his father ever showed so much respect to. It just always bothered him that he couldn´t even start to comprehend the whole situation the order of the stairs of power where set as.<br>
<br>
Well ultimately it didn't really matter to him. Pondering like this the whole day would never help him in any way other then tiring himself out. The phantom was a friend to him nevertheless and that was all that mattered to him at the moment, or at that age.<br>
<br>
Actually he could remember it clearly. At the age of 12 he was even more stubborn then people would tell him he was at his current age. He wasn't the only one that came from this rare breed. There were multiple characters or subjects, as his father would always call them, that also had the same powers as Clause himself had. It was always just, that he was held in high regards and was treated way more differentl then the rest. He had just received his phantom two years ago, at the moment the sync between him and his phantom, which was crucial for someone of this breed seeing as this determined how strong someone was or how strong someone could become. At that age he didn't even understand a bit of what was going on in the whole village. What was that made him more special anyways?<br>
<br>
He chuckled in slight annoyance as he remembered his own ignorance at that time.<br>
<br>
The village was out of this world, literally and in the sense that the villagers an the whole events that took place there were beyond believe. Inhuman as he would call it. That was why he escaped and just simply left his whole past behind him. He was alone the day he was born anyways. There was no special connection or of some sort that held him there. So the moment he found out of the gruesome ways of that particular place, he escaped and left. While this was not an easy task, seeing as the majority saw him as a viable piece in their plans or whatsoever, they were on to him. So it took more energy and struggling then he orignally expected. Don't get him wrong though, he loved his village and culture. His mom, who would use to tell him all about the village and culture of the country made him love that place, even to this day. Just that secret underground organization that was kept unbeknownst till those days just urged him to run away from that village. It was the best choice said his phantom. The village took everything away the day he found out about absolutely everything. His mom was killed in the progress, his own dad tried capturing himself and killing by those two hands and the fostered love for that village was weakened, all on that single day..<br>
<br>
''..Are you still wondering about that all, still? I told you, you will know everything the day I decide you need to.''<br>
<br>
Clause just simply stared to the ground for a second. His head hanging low he gave himself the moment to clearly think for an decent answer.<br>
<br>
''Well--No, You're right. Sorry for that, I was just recalling some events that are hauting me still from that day..''<br>
<br>
Silence crept in for a moment as both parties decided not to say anything for a moment. Which didn't take long as the phantom continued the mind conversation again ;<br>
<br>
''Well wondering about it even more won't help you in any way.. You know let just drop this subject. Shouldn't you start packing and getting ready? The academt won't wait for you you know.''<br>
<br>
Clause clicked his tonuge in slight annoyment and pushed himself from the bench.<br>
<br>
''I don't need you to tell me that..''<br>
<br>
He walked away at his own pace as the phantom hurriedly tried to keep up with Clause.<br>
<br>
''Well sorry Mr.Split-Personality all of a sudden! Dammit, I miss those times everyone was obliged to respect me..''<br>
<br>
Ignoring the phantom for a moment Clause kept on walking and entered his friends house again to go an pick up his stuff. It was time to move on..<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Name: Fyla<br>
Age: 19<br>
Gender: Female<br>
Race: Human/Adept (you know what those are , right?)<br>
<br>
Personality:A slow going mercury adept, she always takes things very slowly and she never hurries anywhere, she never loses her cool and will never panic. <br>
She however also almost never does anything , she is chronically lazy when it comes to doing anything but herb growing. <br>
Regarding other people Fyla will usually keep them either Alled or neutral as she is incredibly physically frail. <br>
However using Psynergy she usually keeps herself in good health. Without psynergy Fyla easily cathces all sorts of diseases. <br>
If Fyla has to fight she will rather keep herself out of harms way and use her Djinn to attack and defend her. She will also use any allies she can muster.<br>
Fyla is an excellent Herb-grower and Achemist. She can mix up almost anything out of hers collection of herb-seeds (she always carries them with her) Using a psynergy called Grow she can grow herbs anywhere with dirt. She mixed up a lot of potions in her life and some are morally questionable at best.<br>
Fyla doesn't give a damn about other peoples' issues except if those issuess involve her some way or if she can gain use out of the person.<br>
<br>
History:Fyla spent almost whle of her life on a small island called Centrum , she lived in a town called Nya and was the local herbalist. After she turned 16 she went to the lone mountain on Centrum , Aqa . <br>
There she found an teleport device that she accidently triggered , forcing her to leave Centrum permanently. After she understood the situation , Fyla started gathering all sorts of herbs , in hope that using a mix of some she will be able to return on Centrum. However she gave up on the idea after 2 years of search , and now she is simply trying to gather all herbs in the world.<br>
Fyla is deathly ill , always clinging on the verge of death , however her psynergy is keeping her in normal health , so as long as she has psynergy she will live , however if she loses psynergy her illness will kill her in as short as 5 minutes.<br>

<br>
Age: Apparent 18 Real around 600-700<br>
<br>
Gender: Female<br>
<br>
Race: Demon?<br>
<br>
Personality:Nox is the wierdest demon you will probably meet . Aiming to become more humanlike she was outcasted among demons.<br>
 Even though she is a demon she prefers not doing her job , collecting souls, she never does it actually . Nox however is still realtively emotionless and cold , but she is trying to improve her "humanlike" side. <br>
Even worse , Nox's magic of choice is holy magic , and as such her magic is incredibly weak (A demon using holy magic of course its weak). <br>
She prefers using her Rapier (Consilium) for combat , and avoids using magic. <br>
She is somewhat related to winged demons , so she has hidden wings she can extend at wish.<br>
<br>
History: Her early history is unknown , nobody really knows where she came from, but later on Nox was a very bad demon , doing her job poorly , other demons requested of her to leave , so she left to the human world . Hiding from demon hunters she ultimatively enrolled to TJA , in hopes of relative safety.<br>

<br>
Other: Her rapier Consilium(Judgement) is actually a holy weapon , and she can touch it wih bare skin , that is extremely unusual as holy items burn demons on touch. Also her holy magic doesn't effect her.<br>
Her origins are unknown , she is easily the wierdest demon ever seen.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Name:AI 1492 Atalanta<br>
<br>
Age: 890<br>
<br>
Gender: Female personality<br>
<br>
Race: Autonomous AI<br>
<br>
Personality: Atalanta is very lonely , and therefore distant with everybody. She cares for machines as they are living beings , and doesn't like when someone trashes technology.<br>
<br>
History: Atalanta was an AI of a long extinct species , they dissapeared some time before her activation . She was programmed to keep installations operational as long as possible , however after 800 years , all of the installations began to deteriorate due to meeting the end of their predicted operation-time. Therefore Atalanta had to quickly leave the planet if she intended to survive , that marked her autonomy as she overwritten her basic order. She now had no tasks , so she set of on a galaxy wide journey. Using a network of jump gates she could travel very far very quickly. After 90 years of traveling she ran into Earth , a planet inhabited with intelligent creatures.<br>
After that she enrolled to TJA in hope to learn more about Humans  <br>
<br>
Appearance:<br>
<img src="./106673_files/767931-bigthumbnail.jpg" border="0" alt="" onload="NcodeImageResizer.createOn(this);"><br>
<br>
Other: As an AI she either needs to have her  holo-drones or any other piece of technology in the vicinity to exist , without it , she will dissapear , in AI terms , die. That is why Atalanta keeps at least 20 holo-drones in the vicinity just in case. Her holo-drones also have an ability to use lasers to attack , however they are usually not for military applications. Atalanta doesn't need to eat , drink or sleep of course.<br>
Unlike human AI's she can exist outside of computers , anywhere near any technology. She can also access any nearby technology remotely.</div>

How people call her : Eeeeeeeeek!<br>

Age: appears 25 , actually 2001 years old<br>
<br>
Gender: Female<br>
<br>
Race: Ghost princess (A ghost that lived so long it can control other ghosts and spirits)<br>
<br>
Personality: Rather ghost-like, she loves haunting people , sometimes the effect is good sometimes is bad , it depends on her mood , she loves snow and sometimes uses her magic to make it snow during summertimes, also the person she haunts usually gets followed by snow .<br>
<br>
History: She has a long and usually uninteresting history of 2000 years. when she died she was a bonded ghost , bonded to her place of death . But after years she got free so she roamed the earth , she usually sticked to places with a lot of death , absorbing the miasma which came from dead bodies. She also gained powers usually not avabile to normal ghosts , somehow "earning" the rank of a Ghost princess. After a while , she caught attention from a vampire (she can't remember who it was) and he attacked her to gain her powers to control ghosts , however after a long battle the vampire lost , as she lead him to a graveyard , in which she summoned vengeful spirits of the vampire hunters the vampire killed , they all possessed him at the same time and drew his spirit to the netherworld. After that she realised the extent of her power and started to constantly move , she merely stumbled upon TJA , so entered for the fun of it.<br>

Age: 14<br>
Gender: Male<br>
Race: Sky Born child: A being born from the clouds with the ability to control its attributes. They have been secluded and secretive, always on the move their cloud never stays in one place too long, keeping their civilization safe from conflict. Though what they were really doing was keeping their data and intelligence of the E.L.P Eternal Life Project under wraps. They researched   how to create what some may call the “fountain of youth”. <br>
Personality: Normally shy but outgoing unless provoked, uncontrollably curious and very protective. <br>
History: Ari had been born 13 years ago before the incident happened, a member of the Sky born children had been kidnapped and murdered in an attempt to gain the information of the fountain of youth. The race was a pack of wolf like creatures. Two days later on the full moon. When they invaded Ari saw his best friend in the fangs of one of the creatures, as quietly as possible he snuck away covered in the blood of his family toward the elder, he knelt before him and asked him what he should do. “Destroy the E.L.P	, we were too greedy and wanted too much. That it was has caused out downfall dear child, I grant you this gift that only few ever receive this devastating power is not to be used lightly and only to protect something important to you.” Those were the last words before the invaders came into the room, their fangs dripping with blood and flesh.”To protect the remainder of our pride” he said while slowly turning to face them. He lifted his hand and it all went quiet. A slow humming sound…. Then in a flash of great light the beasts and the cloud disappeared, He landed on a mountain and has been taken care of by a very poor orphanage. One year later, The time had come for him to leave and he was sent to T.J.A.<br>

History:He was born in England, ever since he was 10 years old he had a passion for Technology. He loved it more than his own baby sister, which is why he attended his own robotics expo instead of her funeral. She had been shot in a police shootout while trying to apprehend a fugitive. When his parents found out he had snuck away to go to the expo they were furious. At that moment he decided that they didn’t care in his mind all they loved was their daughter, so as he grew he began making more and more robots, when he became 15 he killed his dog in an attempt to bring it back to life with science. It failed. That was when he realized technology was not enouph he needed something, extra, something to give it that extra “oomf”. So he Began to collect books on magic and sorcery, over time he  met up with a man whoshared his passion he was old but wise, he learned much and over the year his persistence prevailed and he mastered it.  His friend died and  he couldn’t stand it, the only person to ever understand him. He modified him and made him into a cyborg, Truly his greatest creation. He intended to make more robots out of dead bodies and so he enrolled in tenshi knowing of its increasing death rate.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Name: Jesse Sky<br>
<br>
Age: 16<br>
<br>
Gender: Female<br>
<br>
Race: Human (...100% I swear.)<br>
<br>
Personality: Pretty airheaded and blonde, completely carefree and playful, but most importantly she's COMPLETELY OBLIVIOUS to any form of danger or anything out of the ordinary even to the highest extremes. So much in fact that if she met a werewolf or anything similar she'd call it an "adorable little puppy" and start petting it. If she went to get a soda from the fridge and there was an alligator inside said fridge, she likely wouldn't notice it at all, even if she was looking all over for that soda but couldn't see it cuz the gator was in the way. And so on...<br>
<br>
History: When she was really young, like 5 or 6, BEFORE she developed such an... interesting personality, Jesse was actually really timid and afraid of just about everything she wasn't familiar with. It was after a traumatizing encounter with a large stray dog at such an age that she had wound up in tears, wishing and praying to not be afraid of anything anymore. And, somehow, though probably thanks to some pranksome creature than anything else, her prayers were more or less answered. As her cowardly personality was replaced by one of blissful unawareness; as if she'd been charmed. Though, it was true, she was never afraid of anything after that. Even her memories of the terrifying world around her shifted based of Jesse's new perspective of the world. Her parents, surprised at her sudden change of self at first, later deemed this airheaded nature to be a part of her, and didn't worry much about it. Her parents sent her off to TJA by request when she'd told them that it was an academy full of "pretty things", which is what she interpreted it as, anyway... <br>

Age: However long the academy has been around for. Looks about 13.<br>

Gender: Female<br>
<br>
Race: Microz<br>
<br>
Personality: The quiet type. Doesn't say much. Niniane usually has a pretty blank expression on her face, and believes actions speak louder than words. She does things that will benefit the members of her subject, as their happiness fuels her power. <br>
<br>
History: Came into being as Tenshi Jikogu did. As a Microz, her respective "subject" that her powers align with was supernatural beings, and was summoned into this world as a result of the academy's existence, as having so many supernatural creatures collectively gathered in one place was what gave her enough strength to live in this world. Since her summoning, she hasn't been doing much... and has mainly been in a deep slumber underneath the school all this time. <br>

<br>
Other: <br>
-She indirectly depends on the academy itself for her strength and survival, therefore she cannot stray far from TJA without growing weak, and if the school were to ever be completely disbanded, and all the students sent their separate ways, Niniane would cease to exist. <br>
-She has somewhat of an omnipotence for all the non-human students in the school. She doesn't know everything about them to a T, but she would know things like their name, general history and general species information. She would almost appear to be a mind-reader. <br>
-Emotional pain for the non-human students means physical pain to her, especially at close range. Therefore Niniane will tend to gravitate towards the more glass-half-full-type people. <br>
-Her powers can be associated with a bluish glow, or a flash of light of that color.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Name: Orion<br>
<br>
Age: Looks about 17, really only about 10<br>
<br>
Gender: male<br>
<br>
Race: silver (coyote) <br>
<br>
Personality: The fun-loving type of guy that never listens to the rules. He throws caution to the wind and loves excitement, which is why he so loves his powers. Also a complete ladies' man, er, coyote... and a little Whoopi Goldbergist. <br>
<br>
History: Lived the first few years of his life as an ordinary coyote, doing ordinary coyote things... like <span style="text-decoration: line-through">chasing road runners</span> picking fights. One evening he'd encountered an odd-looking wolf with a crescent shape on his side in a place where he shouldn't have been, so being typical Orion he wanted to see if what he'd heard was true and wolves really did have stronger builds than coyotes. <br>
<br>
The wolf didn't seem like he was in the mood for a fight, but he wouldn't walk away from one either. The wolf was suppressing his true strength and played fair, but even then it turned into a nasty fight. The trouble began when Orion bit into the wolf's throat, drawing blood, with an... interesting taste to it, and an even more interesting color. The wolf was not aware of what had just happened, so the fight continued. As it progressed, though, Orion found himself with immense strength, and so did the wolf, once he had been pushed far enough to use it. That wolf got his power from his blood, and after the one taste he had of it, Orion did, as well. <br>
<br>
Another power that came with being a silver was that he could understand the wolf perfectly... which was great cuz said wolf pretty much started yelling at him, and himself for letting his power fall to such an irresponsible creature... as he'd said. Orion however, after experimenting a bit, learned he <i>loved</i> these new powers, and wasn't listening much to Moon's lecture. No matter how much Moon tried to tell him he needed to be extremely careful to make sure his blood didn't wind up spreading to other creatures, especially humans, and how he should use his powers conservatively so that he didn't draw attention to himself, blah blah blah... Orion used his powers frivolously and as often as possible, and, needless to say, became quite an annoyance to the head silver. <br>
<br>
Later on, because of his longevity the blood granted him, he became bored of his life as a wild beast, and created a human form with himself, blending into human life, which he found <i>far</i> more fun. However, fitting in wasn't as easy as he'd thought, even after he'd learned everything he needed to know about being human, since there were some holes in the illusion... like the fact that silvers cannot sleep in a disguised form. Which is especially problematic since he so much enjoys sleeping with human women...<br>
<br>
And so, to find someplace where he wouldn't be called a monster and maybe the girls he slept with wouldn't scream and freak out when they woke up to find a coyote sleeping next to them, Orion left for TJA, in hopes it still had everything he liked about human life and more. <br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Name: Moon<br>
<br>
Age: 17<br>
<br>
Gender: Male<br>
<br>
Race: Silver<br>
<br>
Personality: Very stoic and serious, kinda agnsty. But he also has his virtues, like, he doesn't like to kill unless completely necessary (like hunting for food, as a wolf) and he never uses his powers for hunting or other basic tasks since he deems it as 'cheating'. He can also be a bit curious about human things sometimes since he hadn't been human forever and still has a lot to learn.<br>
<br>
History: Born as a wolf, living a normal wolf life, except... he's had the silver blood for as long as he can remember, not sure how he obtained it. Moon was the name given to him by his parents, thanks to the crescent moon-shaped birthmark on his right side. Upon discovering his powers as a pup, he used to use them freely, quite enjoying them. But when greedy humans saw that he could do these things, he became a bit of an urban legend among the nearby community, 'the flying wolf', and soon, people began trying to hunt him down, as if making a game of it. Of course, Moon was never captured, since his powers made him too great to be caught, but sadly, the hunters began going for <i>any</i> wolf they came across, thinking it was him, and sadly, Moon lost his entire family and pack before he knew it. He could only hope that some of them escaped instead of being killed, but, none of them were seen again.<br>
<br>
After that, he didn't like using his powers as much. Moon realized they could be more of a curse than a blessing at times, and didn't want them to be greatly known. He traveled quite a bit, no longer having a home (though he did sort of become friends with a bird that he named Goldie ^^), and eventually decided that he should try starting out a new life in the form of another being, since his blood allowed him to shape shift. He transformed himself into a human, and, while still in the process of learning about humans and their ways, eventually found himself at TJA. <br>

(In his human form, that birthmark thingy moves to his upper right arm, where it looks like a tattoo, but it's usually concealed by his clothing anyway...)<br>
<br>
Other: Having been born a wolf, he is much more comfortable in his wolf form than his human form, and tends to revert to a wolf upon being given the chance. And... Goldie, the bird mentioned, may or may not be seen very much depending on how things play out... but if she does show up, then she's kinda like Moon's Navi, minus the annoying voice, and the closest thing to a friend or family he has.</div>

    <div>
        <div class="spoiler" style="display: none;">Jared's life was rather average for a human. He graduated high school and college with a career in software designing in mind. He was having a little bit of trouble finding an actual job, though, after he'd been laid off from a previous job, and his whole life changed the day he was at home, relaxing, minding his own... when he heard a female voice calling him from somewhere. The voice sounded like... pleading, begging, calling for help. Saying something about being trapped. Calling for a human to help them. Jared was utterly confused by this. He lived alone, after all. He must've been hearing things. But the voice continued. Hesitantly, he tried following the voice in the direction it seemed to be coming from, which was his basement. And once he got as close to the mysterious voice as it seemed he could, he finally responded to it with his own voice, asking who they were, or if they were even real. <br>
<br>
Much to his confusion, this was met with the girl's voice sounding relieved that a human had answered her plea, and asked Jared to... turn on some sort of game console? The voice described how she was trapped in a console of sorts, and that she'd only be able to free herself if the system was turned on by a human. Still hesitant, Jared wondered if this was in reference to the N64 he hadn't played in years. After all it seemed the voice got louder when he walked closer to that particular system. So he turned it on, and was immediately met by the voice's gratefulness. The voice then introduced herself as Cookie, and claimed to be of a race called Code Walkers. Jared was confused, and a little afraid, and a bit disbelieving that the whole situation was even happening, but Cookie seemed to be friendly, so he went along with it. Cookie explained how Code Walkers are digital creatures that live inside electronic devices like computers, cell phones and game consoles, and feed off of small amounts of data at each host, so their presence will likely go unnoticed. Which is when she added that she had moved from the N64 to Jared's phone.<br>
<br>
Aaaaaand after that things went bad... once again Cookie was screaming to help, but not because she was trapped, because she was being attacked. From what Jared could make out between the sounds of struggle, there was now another one of these Code Walker things in his phone as well. But it wasn't like Cookie, it wasn't one of the Code Walkers that hardly sticks around for any time at all, eats a small amount of data, and leaves. This Code Walker was the kind that eats massive amounts of data at a time, including other Code Walkers, and it was after Cookie! Jared dropped the phone in surprise, trying to quickly think of something he could do to save her. Cookie pleaded that she needed another host to escape to, but where would she go that the Cannibal wouldn't follow? While Jared was still thinking of what he could possibly do, he was a bit surprised to find that Cookie seemed to have already found someplace to hide. There not being any other available hosts nearby, that he knew of, Jared was a bit curious as to where she went, and so he asked her... then decided he didn't exactly want to know... <br>
<br>
...Because Cookie said she had somehow managed to warp inside Jared's brain... <br>
<br>
Jared immediately went into a panic at such a notion. And if that data-devouring monster that Cookie had informed him of could follow her there... Jared tore the battery out of his phone as quickly as possible, ensuring that that thing would <i>not</i> be able to attack him, and still running on raw fear, wound up smashing his phone onto his hard basement floor, where it broke into several pieces.<br>
<br>
Cookie tried as hard as she could to calm him down, assuring him that the Cannibal was completely trapped, and that she herself would never try to eat out his brains or anything like that... Though Jared still wasn't completely for the idea of her staying in there for very long, but... at the same time, he didn't want her to be attacked by one of those monsters... so, reluctantly, Jared eventually allowed her to stay there.<br>
<br>
Several years later Jared became quite used to Cookie's company and thought of her as a close friend of his. What he didn't understand though was how she lived so long, since Cookie told him that Code Walkers typically don't live to be more than a month old, but he certainly wasn't complaining, he was happy that Cookie was getting to live such a long life. <br>
<br>
Jared eventually found himself headed to TJA, not as a student but for a job opportunity, as he was going to be teaching computer design at the academy. </div>

        <div class="spoiler" style="display: none;">Cookie lived as an ordinary Code Walker for the first week and a half of her life. However due to her careless nature she accidentally trapped herself in a de-activated (turned off) electronic host, where she would starve to death if the host wasn't activated by a human, so she could warp out of it. Despite the basic CW instinct that they should never talk to humans, Cookie called out for help, which meant all nearby humans could hear her as a voice in their head. <br>
<br>
Much to her luck, it turned out a human was close enough to hear her, though they seemed scared and confused of the voice they were hearing, and demanded to know who it was. Cookie tried to explain that she was trapped somewhere in what appeared to be a game console, and that if the system was turned on, she could escape. Eventually, Jared was persuaded to do as she said, and Cookie was set free. Out of gratefulness, however, she didn't dare leave his side! She went right from there to his cell phone and continued to communicate with the human. She explained to him what she was, and how if Jared didn't come to her aid, she could've starved.<br>
<br>
Just as Jared was beginning to let the concept soak in, however, Cookie was unfortunate enough to run into a Cannibal - a dangerous, monster like breed of Code Walker which eats massive amount of data at a time, including weaker breeds of CW's - while still inside Jared's phone. Cookie had to escape or else she'd get eaten! Without thinking, she quickly warped to the nearest host available, except... there were no other electronic hosts within range at that point, and Cookie had just managed to reach the little-known, <i>living</i> host, AKA she just jumped inside Jared's brain, which of course left the poor human far more scared and confused than he previously was. The electronic host she came from was then destroyed, so the Cannibal was no longer a problem, but then there was the problem of the scared-out-of-hit-wits human... <br>
<br>
It took quite a bit of getting used to, but eventually Jared accepted the idea of some undiscovered digital creature living inside his head, and allowed Cookie to continue living there. What confused both of them though was how long Cookie grew to live... as most Code Walkers don't live much longer than a month. Cookie was still extremely grateful to the human for saving her life as well as whatever he did to lengthen it, as well as taking responsibility over her and keeping her safe in later years.</div>

Other: <br>
-Note she has no physical form. The image above is only how she would appear to another Code Walker or other sort of digital creature on the digital plane. Also she can present herself through technology (like on a computer screen) with this appearance if she chooses to, or she can present herself in that way as really anything she wants.<br>
-As a Code Walker, she has no need to sleep, though at night she sometimes likes to interact with Jared or possibly other living hosts in their dreams. <br>
-Most Code Walkers (of the Descendant breed) don't live to be nearly as old as Cookie, she has only lived to this age by the mysterious means that continuously residing in a living host lengthens a Code Walker's lifespan, which neither Cookie nor Jared completely understand.<br>
-She is capable of more or less "possessing" a living host, but only when the host is voluntarily allowing it.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Name: Cursor<br>
<br>
Age: 46 days<br>
<br>
Gender: Female<br>
<br>
Race: (Cannibal) Code Walker<br>
<br>
Personality: Cursor is conniving and mischievous. Like most cannibal breeds of code walkers, she finds ordinary computer data distasteful, and instead insists on dining on the intricate programming of fellow code walkers. Because of this, she most enjoys tricking her prey into thinking she is harmless, into thinking she is one of them... before devouring them, not leaving a trace of their existence.<br>
<br>
History: Like all code walkers, Cursor had no parents and was left to learn the digital world on her own, though thankfully the rules were easy to learn. Taste. Warp. Taste again. Warp again. Never talk to humans. Simple stuff.<br>
<br>
However... desperate times call for desperate measures. She at one point made the simple yet fatal mistake many of her kind make- she wound up inside a host that was deactivated, which meant he was trapped. <br>
<br>
It was quite a while before she was eventually freed... during that time, not only was the host sucked dry, but she nearly starved, and began to lose her sanity as well. It was with a glimmer of hope she was joined by a second code walker, and, hunger having driven her mad, did not hesitate to attack. Cursor broke one of the most important yet unspoken rules- she fed directly off of another walker's data, ending another's life and lengthening her own, but at the sake of her own sanity. Shortly after, by an incredible stroke of luck, the host was activated again and gave the demented creature a chance to escape.<br>
<br>
She continues to live the life of a cannibal breed code walker, in particular, by deceiving her fellow kind into thinking she is harmless, and luring them into her reach... <br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Name: Miku<br>
<br>
Age: 18<br>
<br>
Race: Neko/Necromancer<br>
<br>
Appearance:<br>
<table class="ncode_imageresizer_warning" id="ncode_imageresizer_warning_54" width="316"><tbody><tr><td width="20" class="td1"><img src="./106673_files/wol_error.gif" width="16" height="16" alt="" border="0"></td><td class="td2">Click this bar to view the full image.</td></tr></tbody></table><img src="./106673_files/Mikupic5.jpg" border="0" alt="" onload="NcodeImageResizer.createOn(this);" id="ncode_imageresizer_container_54" height="451" width="316"><br>
<br>
Personality: Usually cheerful and likes to make people happy, however she is so sensitive to other people's feelings that the dsaness of others can make her depressed and even leave her in a weak physical state. Likewise, the happiness of others can make her full of energy and even enhance her necromancing ability. Feels overly oblidged to help others to the point of leaving herself completely drained, since the use of her powers requires a lot of energy.<br>
<br>
History: Miku's mother was a neko with duck-butt-shaped hair who had Miku as a teenager, but the walking pile of angst was too busy trying to get revenge on her older brother for killing her parents, and never paid Miku any attention, because, YES, THAT <i>IS</i> MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE FACT THAT SOME MYSTERIOUS NECROMANCER FATHER WALKED OUT ON HER AND HER CHILD!!!<br>
<br>
Later, said neko mother was hunted down and brutally killed by a secret organization trying to take out her kind, leaving Miku all alone. Miku, who had been badly neglected as a child, was left with no choice after her mother died to leave home and try to find a way to survive. On the edge of her life, she was found and rescued by a pair of blonde twins who took her in and introduced her to a group of otaku girls who took care of her after that. The girls' general happiness made Miku's recovery happen surprizingly quickly, and the girls introduced her to the wonderful creation that is anime, manga, and all things Japanese. She became a hardcore otaku even faster than the girls did and as they all grew up she eventully went on to become priestess of the otaku faith. Though after leaving home she soon realized that with her extremely oddball history and race there were few places she could be accepted in society, and so she hopped from home to home for a while trying to find a place to live. <br>
<br>
It was while staying with a redhead with an odd obsession with sand she learned of her necromancer ability. When Miku saw how saddened the ginger was over his recent loss of his brother, Miku wished more than anything to be able to help him, and somehow she managed to revive his brother in a brilliant flash of purple. <br>
<br>
The ginger was extremely grateful though she and him both knew that with powers like these she was even more of an oddity, and it may be hard for her to blend in normally amongst humans. With that, Miku needed to find a place to stay that would be safe for her, a place that would allow her kind to live without worry of danger coming towards her, and so she set her sights on TJA.<br>
<br>
Other:<br>
-Powers are characterized by a purple flash/light, or just the color purple in general.<br>
-Has a tendency to "nya" and "mew" quite a bit...<br>
-If you caught all the references and cameos in this and know who this character <i>really</i> is... *gives cookie*<br>

				</div>
				<div style="font-style:italic">Name: Kei Tachibana (aka. "Captain K. Farukon" or "Akuma the Man"; depends on his attitude)<br>
<br>
Age: 18; looks 25 when acting like C.K; his face looks 64 when he is acting like Akuma.<br>
<br>
Gender: Male<br>
<br>
Race: Hollow-Blood<br>
<br>
Personality: He could be a little out-going when he feels a little too good. When around girls, he becomes clueless on what to say in most occassions because he is too focused "analyzing" them for "details". Kei is not really interested in things he doesn't care about or dislikes and tends to keep them out of his sight. He is incredibly friendly to others, but he uses this to annoy people who dislike him for his own amusement. However, his major downside is that his body has at least any part seeping with blood, his personality will flip off and turn into an undescribable mess in his mind; the easiest way to let him rest is by fainting him and leave him next to a bottle of beer, although the only MAIN problem is fainting him.<br>
<br>
Also, Kei sometimes acts like a 4-year old.<br>
<br>
History: Hollow-Bloods are humans born with a unique hemophobia (fear of blood) that kicks up when they see blood coming out of their own body. These humans have increased speed, breathing abilities, education, and strength, but their humanity stays the same as long as they don't see the things mentioned earlier. Kei isn't your typical Hollow-Blood.<br>
<br>
He was born with a mind-defection, and because he was known to be dead when born, he was buried in the soft ground. However, when nobody was looking, the baby woke up. He stayed there until he grew restless and eventually dug his way out. His increased abilities let him stay breathing normally while he was inside his own grave. A man named Mark Noxus went by and found Kei wandering around; due to his, fortunately, kind nature, he instantly adopted the baby.<br>
<br>
Four years passed since the incident. Kei is slowly growing up like how a normal human being should. However, one day, his father suddenly disappeared without letting the kid notice. When he found out, however, he began looking around the whole house for him. The only thing he found was a note in the man's personal closet that said,<br>
<br>
"If you are reading this, you are probably the boy I had taken care of for four whole years. I wished I had made this right before I left, but my disappearance is private.<br>
<br>
The truth is, I was actually a scientist working for my own lab. You were so smart compared to most babies I had ever met in orphanages, so I examined you. You... are gifted. Very gifted. You have a boost to your thinking abilities, as well as physical strength. Not only do you have that, but you also have very strange cells in your muscles that I could not describe in words.<br>
<br>
Now, there should be a pill attached to this letter wrapped in a cloth... I could not know why, but this was stuck in your head for an unreasonably long time. I examined it, but this seems to furthermore enhance yourself seeing how it has a reaction to your cells. But be aware that anything could happen during the middle of the process. When you grow up until you're at least 15 or older, I advise you to... go... to the Tenshi Jigoku Academy, and begin your school life there; I know it may be strange to skip what is called 'Elementary School's, but I believe that it would be best for you to go at that time, because the truth is, something dreadful is within you.<br>
<br>
Apparently, you are very hemophobic to your very own blood cells. I never wanted to try this out in real life, so I still do not know what would exactly happen. So you should... just... be careful.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>
Mark J. Noxus."<br>
<br>
Kei had only understood several parts of the letter, so he took off the pill from the letter and ate it (with water, of course). He felt a strange, dizzy feeling inside him. Eventually, he slept on the ground.<br>
<br>
When he woke up, he did feel better than last time. What took him time to realize, however, was his instant growth. Apparently, not only did the pill increase his overall capabilities, but it also affected his physical appearance. He read the letter once more, only this time, understanding all of the letter. Keeping it safe his pocket (he borrowed some of his father's older clothes). He decided to go this so-called "Tenshi Jigoku Academy" and find out why it actually fits him and what it would be like.<br>
<br>
And so, he goes on with his things packed up.<br>
<br>
Appearance: <table class="ncode_imageresizer_warning" id="ncode_imageresizer_warning_52" width="331"><tbody><tr><td width="20" class="td1"><img src="./106673_files/wol_error.gif" width="16" height="16" alt="" border="0"></td><td class="td2">Click this bar to view the full image.</td></tr></tbody></table><img src="./106673_files/keitachibanaocsubmissio.png" border="0" alt="" onload="NcodeImageResizer.createOn(this);" id="ncode_imageresizer_container_52" height="451" width="331"><br>
<br>
"Kei, who has snapped by his own mortal blood" form - Not much different, except his eyes are gone (meaning you cannot blind him, but he has less 'visible' sight), and he has a slightly bigger buff than usual. Also, his back has a huge sign written in blood marking "Hollow". Also, this form could easily be tricked when the trick is used in a clever way.<br>
<br>
Other: When Kei fights normally, he uses either a wrench, street fighting, or random crap styles. "Kei, who has snapped by his own mortal blood", or "The Empty Format", uses Ansatsuken (a form of assassination), along with a strangely sharp butter knife when near to being defeated.<br>
<br>
Also, he loves crackers, so it would be best to feed him that if you wanna be friends with him. o_O<br>
<br>

God, that drawing took forever to draw. D:<br>
Hope there's room for me, and I also hope that I made this well enough.<br>

Age: Appears as 16, but is acutally several millennia old<br>

Gender: Male<br>
-<br>
Race: Demon<br>
-<br>
Personality: Akuma lost his sanity long ago. He is couragous, or maybe just stupid...possibly both, either way, he doesn't get stopped by fear. He loves fighting, almost as much as he loves strawberry angel cake. He is a very comitted guy, he never backs down from a goal. He can be trusted with about anything, as long as you give him circumstances and such.<br>
-<br>
History: Akuma had lived in the Eigth Layer of Hell(reffering to Dante's inferno). He watched over the layer, keeping other demons in order. He loved watching the humans suffer. During his existance, he lost his sanity, letting it freeze in the lowest layer of hell, under his master's feet. His master, Satan, ordered him to walk amongst the living on the surface of Earth. He accepted his master's order, leaving hell to torture many humans, and examining their everyday life. He wanted to see how they treated each other on the surface. He joined an academy, to learn about Earth's history, and to be close to the most dramatic of all ages, Teenagers.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Name: Necerei Mecran (Necei) (Pronounced: Ness-er-ay Mess-ran [Neh-say]) <br>
Age: Appears 18, but has existed for more than several thousand years.<br>
Gender: Male<br>
Race: Necromancer<br>
Personality: Necei is a bubbly type of person. Even though he uses necromancy, he is very positive and rarely ever negative towards anyone. He tends to have quite the sweet tooth; candy, cakes, ice cream, etc. Usually sugary foods can calm him down, unless he’s in the middle of a fight. During a fight, he hates being distracted, even by really good friends. He doesn’t have much tolerance for distractions. He often hangs around graveyards, talking with the dead, sharing experiences.<br>
History: Necei’s lived for thousands of years, replacing his body parts with fresh ones, except his brain. By keeping his brain, he’s been capable of surviving many drastic events that would leave a regular human dead. He’s gone through epidemics, wars, and several catastrophes. During his first 20 years of living, he studied witch craft, sorcery, and necromancy under his mother’s teachings. Witch craft and sorcery weren’t exactly his thing, so he focused mostly on necromancy. His mother got sick when he was 18. So, he attempted to use his powers to keep her alive. However, something went wrong and the regular human limbs couldn’t sustain all of her magic. She then died, screaming in agony. The villagers suspected something, so they searched the house, but he got out before they could find him. The villagers burned his mother, after finding all the potions, books, and magic circles in the house. He stood in the background, watching with tears rolling down his face. He wanted to avenge his mother, so he rose the dead out from the woods that surrounded the small village; animals, humans, and beasts alike all came to destroy the village, leaving it in ruins. He left the village, or whatever remained of it, never to return again. From then on, he’s killed, tortured, and conducted many experiments on the humans, using the good healthy bodies to replace his own. <br>
Now, he creeps around the graveyard north of TJA, readying himself to enter the school. <br>

<br>
<b><i>Age</i></b>: 17 (actual 170)<br>
<br>
<b><i>Gender</i></b>: Male<br>
<br>
<b><i>Race</i></b>: Werewolf <br>
<br>
<b><i>Personality</i></b>: Despite his Large and Scary appearance, Tobias is actually very quiet, borderline mute, and a bit timid. He is incredibly kind, and tries to be generally nice to everyone and doesn't really like fighting, but it is difficult to hold back his animal instincts, and is brutal when truly angered. He loves flowers and other delicate things, but is afraid to touch them for fear of him crushing it. He is most dangerous when Angry <i><u>and</u></i> calm<br>
History: Despite his size, he was the runt amongst his two older brothers, who loved fighting and their animalistic urges, he was cast out due to his (at the time) half blooded and pacifistic nature. He always was attacked by others to prove his worth, but he never fought back. Until his older brother was attacked by another tribe, he unleashed all his power and fury and slaughtered the wolf with ease. With this the tribe found a way to deal with the enemy tribes as well as train the "runt". he was used as a weapon, showing to have been the strongest of them. One day, after years as being used as a weapon, he stubled across a person called Madam Witch, who made him an offer, "You want power, but you also want control, yes? Allow me to make you, stronger, all I want...is a capable sword" After much negotiation, he agreed, becoming a full werewolf, while keeping his humanity, he trained under the witch on the pretense that he was killed so his clan will not look for him. He learned of magic, and learned how to enforce magic through shouts. On their travels, he ended up enrolling in Tenshi Jigoku academy. <br>

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="spoiler" style="display: none;"> Tobias is a Halfbreed, that is one of his parents were human. The other half of his werewolf blood came magically, given to him via a magical contract, this gave him the powers and werewolf blood of a natural born, with the side effect of magical abilities. But makes him susceptible to the beast like instincts, leaving him a bit unstable. This unstability was coped with in the forms of the Personalities in his head. Instinct or Pride, and Insanity of Madness. he needs to keep these personalities in check lest he fall to one, or worse, both of them. nonethe less he is allowed to go into multiple "Pseudo" transformations without drawing on either personality.<br>
<br>
<u><b><i>Stage 1</i></b></u>: The most human stage, and one that is rarely used, he has the strength of an exceptionally strong human, and slightly higher senses, This stage is used as a fail safe for when his personalities go out of control. as he has no access to his powers or his wolf blood, and the voices cannot reach him for at least 4 days.<br>
<br>
<b><i><u>Stage 2</u></i></b>: This is the default stage he is in, His strength is 2.5x stronger than his last form, his senses now just higher than a wolf and he is much faster, able to appear as a running blur. He has some wolf like traits, such as some fur around him, and sharper teeth. The voices can reach him, but it is difficult when there are others near him or there is a sanity anchor, something to keep him calm, is nearby. He is susceptible to the voices when he is upset.<br>
<br>
<b><i><u>Stage 3</u></i></b>: An upgraded form of stage 2, his strength is now 4.5x stronger than stage one, around the brute strength of an Ox or a bull, and is much faster, now able to disappear in a blur to those who aren't able to keep up. His senses are much more heightened, but controlled and suppressed for efficiency, even as he closes his eyes, he is able to create a mental map via the other senses. The voices are now close to him, and he is able to speak with them on an equal level. He gains more canine traits, his teeth grow to fangs, his face more wolf like, his ears turn into sharp canine ears. and he now has sharper claws and feet. He now on instinct runs on all fours.<br>
<b><i><u><br>
Stage 4</u></i></b>: a form rarely used, as he needs approval from at least 2 of the voices. He grows yet his appearance and whether his speed or strength is heightened changes on who approved<br>
<br>
<b><i><u>Stage 4 (a)</u></i></b>: Insanity version; Insanity has taken control, his eyes show some sort of spirals in them, He grows in speed and stamina, allowing him to dish out a lot of damage and endure while appearing as a black blur, all with that mad grin on his face. Though he has little defense, it's hard to hit him. he is 5.6x stronger than his first stage.<br>
<br>
<b><i><u>Stage 4 (b)</u></i></b>: Instinct version; Instinct has taken control, his eyes now glow with the insignia of his tribe, 4 black claw marks. He grows in power and defense, allowing him to dish out and take hits equally. Though he loses a lot of his speed, and he is much more bulkier and stronger. he is 7.8 times stronger than the first stage.<br>
<br>
<b><i><u>Stage 5</u></i></b>: The final stage of transformation, and requires both of the voices' approval. He is now in sync with the other persona's thinking acting and planning alike, they have submitted to Tobias' will. He grows massive, 7'6 feet tall and towers over most his strength is now 12.6 times stronger than his original state and is around the strength of giants. He is incredibly fast, able to move about as a blur, and even move fast enough to create after images. This form while being powerful, has drawbacks, the forms transformation breaks down the users body, and the pressure leaves him drained and crack his bones. His sense of sight is nearly gone, a failsafe to protect him from the light, and forces him to use his other senses, something that follows him for 4 hours after transforming back. He is fully in werewolf form looking like a giant anthropomorphic wolf, most of the time his shirts and shoes don't survive the transformation. The time limit of this form cannot go over 15 minutes. after this form he will return to stage one completely blind.</div>

Tobias, due to being trained by the witch, is able to cast magic, though the strength of the spells varies, and it grows with the forms. Though each spell takes away a set percentage of magical output, and the cycle resets every 24 hours once it hits zero, slowly regenerating.<br>
Wind: He is able to cast low-mid level wind spells, mostly surrounding the using of sharp winds and extending his claw reach, he is able to create small air burst that allow him to multi-jump.<br>
Spells:<br>
<b><i><u>Aaius</u></i></b>(2%): sends a blast of sharp wind down towards the target, allows him to cut steels and mark titanium, it gains power and width the farther away Tobias is from the target. <br>
          <br>
<b><i><u>Aaius Trium</u></i></b>(3%): Sends three sharp wind blasts at the target from his claws, stronger and more condensed version of Aaius, but loses power the farther away, is best for close combat and can be attached to his claws to extend his claws reach.<br>
           <br>
<i><b><u>Gusten</u></b></i>(5%): Sends a dense blast of air to blow away a target at high speeds.<br>
          <br>
<b><i><u>Space/Time</u></i></b>: This is an ability he gained through various studies with the witch, and something that's hard for him to use without a focal point, which he creates in the form of music. he is able to manuipulate his enviorment around him, though many take up a large amount of magic and have cooldown times of between 3 and 10 minutes. <br>
    <br>
<u><i><b>Larghissimo</b></i></u>(15%) — very, very slow (20 bpm and below); that slows projectile objects sent towards him.<br>
    <br>
<b><i><u>Grave</u></i></b>(350%-380%) — slow and solemn (20–40 bpm); an attack that cost a higher magical energy than he could ever hope to use. It loosens the particles in the surrounding area from eachother, effectively dissintegrating everything within a set radius of the casters.. He is only able to do this when assisted by a sanity anchor with high magical output.<br>
    <br>
<i><b><u>Lento </u></b></i>— slowly (40–60 bpm) ; N/A<br>
   <br>
<b><i><u> Largo</u></i></b> — broadly (40–60 bpm); N/A<br>
    <br>
<b><i><u>Larghetto</u></i></b> — rather broadly (60–66 bpm); N/A<br>
    <br>
<b><i><u>Adagio</u></i></b>(20%) — slow and stately (literally, "at ease") (66–76 bpm); Calms the muscles of the target and slows their perception of time, <br>
    <br>
<b><i><u>Adagietto</u></i></b>(30%) — rather slow (70–80 bpm); Improved version of Adagietto<br>
<b><i><u>    <br>
Andante Moderato</u></i></b> — a bit slower than andante (N/A)<br>
    <br>
<b><i><u>Andante</u></i></b>(10%) — at a walking pace (76–108 bpm); Lightens Tobias's weight, sacrificing power for more speed.<br>
<i><u><b>    <br>
Andantino</b></u></i>(15%) – slightly faster than andante; more drastic version of Adante<br>
    <br>
<b><i><u>Moderato</u></i></b> — moderately (108–120 bpm)<br>

<b><i><u>Allegretto</u></i></b> — moderately fast (but less so than allegro)<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Yuki Syfa<br>
17 Year Old Female Human-Elemental Hybrid<br>
BiWhoopi Goldbergual<br>
<br>
Personality: Yuki has pretty typically qualities for both elementals and humans. She is fairly kindhearted, but unable to understand social ques. Because of this, she tends to be quite direct and slightly clingy. She also is very reactionary, which makes her fairly fun to prank. Typically she understands that it is just done for fun(after reading a book about it), but occationally she becomes upset when she feels she is being treated like a toy. Her elemental fire magic likes to flare up when she has extremes of emotion, so be careful about scaring her.<br>
<br>
History: Yuki came from a faraway place, in which old traditions have held firm. She was the offspring of a wizard, and an elemental summoning, making her very birth taboo. It was because of this there were many attempted murrders on the young girl. The father was bound to stay because he broke his blood contract with that elemental by having unwilled intercourse. So held guarded her for her infantcy, but then sent her off to a place where she would be safe. Far far away from her old life.<br>
<br>
After leaving, she was considered orphaned, and because she appeared to be an absolutely adorable girl with great temperment, she was quickly taken up, but apon realizing what she was, she would be sent back, or run back beaten like the devil's spawn. She didn't have the mental skills to recognize exactly what it was that made all the people she loved abondon her. She read a great deal of books looking for the answer, but she never could understand that it was her fire that scared people, as nobody would tell it to her straight. On the up side, after reading all these books, she has a great deal of knowledge. However her mom, occationally came to terrorize her for making something of her life. One night a orphanage worker saw this, and that was that.<br>
<br>
Now even the orphange gave up on the girl, and she was sent to TJA where they wouldn't have to deal with her anymore. She hopes to make friends and continue studies. More than anything, she is looking to seek out someone like her. Someone different. But would there be anyone like that at TJA? (Many more than she could have ever thought)<br>

    <div>
        <div class="hider" style="display: none;">Gender Ratio: 95% Genderless, 4% Male, 1% Female<br>
<br>
Appearance: An elemental is made up entirely over the element it has control over. Although they can take whatever form they like, the general form they assume is that of a human without feet, because it is easiest to move aroound in, and allows sight to be extended upward by streching. The noble blooded elementals are those who have been around since the beginning of time, and have a slightly different appearance to those created afterwards. The most notable being their radiant aura, making them seem like divinity.<br>
<br>
Traits: Elementals are highly loyal, and do not naturally exist in the same plane of existance. Gods and humans alike, are able to contract them in exchange for maintaining their existance in our plane. Even the proudest most powerful elemental is unable to break contract with anyone who summons them. <br>
<br>
These creatures are very powerful, for the reason that they are invulnerable. You can only hope to offer up more energy to gain control of them, or outlast their own source of energy. The elementals can only truely die if they violate their contract.<br>
<br>
An elementals body is made up purely of one element, but the noble born are able to change the properties of what they are made of. Noble born are not only immortals, but also they are the only elementals that have genders. Any children they have will be genderless, and will have an average lifespan of 120-150 years.<br>
<br>
Abilities: Elementals have complete control over their particular element. They last longer if summoned in an area that promotes their element.<br>
<br>
Noble borns are different in that they can actually alter the properties of their natural element, they have a much larger pool of energy, create more of an element, and can summon themselves for a large cost of energy(a crippling amount).<br>
<br>
History: Little is known, as elementals do not allow anything into their diminsion that didn't come from it. Nobody who traveled to their plane has ever come back.</div>

<br>
Next, an explanation of Yuki's race and abilities.<br>
<br>
<div>
    <div class="pre-hider">

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="hider" style="display: none;">Yuki is actually both a noble born, and a human at the same time. She assumed properties of each, which made her distinctly different from both. Yuki has human emotions, as well as body structure, however she doesn't have a full set of reactions that humans are born with. Because elementals are naturally invulerable, she does not worry about her well being.<br>
<br>
Yuki's fire is actually not even fire. It is pure energy, and it takes the form of fire to reflect apon Yuki's nature. Noble borns are able to change the properties of whatever they feel like as long as they have the amount of energy required to do it, but being part human, she is bound by the laws of physics. Instead, Yuki's element itself takes form depending on what she aims to do, and changes color to represent a change in her state of mind. These flames can only be used while fire aura is active. <br>
<br>
<div>
    <div class="pre-hider">
	<input type="button" value="Fire Aura" style="max-width:200px;font-size:10px;margin:0 auto;padding:0px;" onclick="if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName(&#39;div&#39;)[1].getElementsByTagName(&#39;div&#39;)[0].style.display != &#39;&#39;)

					this.value = &#39;Fire Aura&#39;;
				}">
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="hider" style="display: none;"> Fire aura is the mode in which Yuki gains access to her elemental powers. It is activated by strong feelings, and uses a good deal of energy to maintain. Fire aura is both a weapon, and a defense mechanisim. Should anything happen that could harm her both physically or emotionally, a different type of fire will be able to activate. To get an idea of how taxing the aura is on Yuki, this aura (unless green flame is used) takes 200 calories of energy to remain active for a single minite. Furthermore, fire aura can only be active 7 minites at a time before it turns off. How much fire is created does not affect this cost, but it also takes calories to simply move around. To top this off, her body has more compact muscle structure than the average human, making her strong but not big. All this considered, Yuki needs at least 4000 calories a day simply to sit around, and at least 8000 if she expects to fight for 15 minites. Yuki eats a lot more food than most people.</div>

<font color="Lime">Green-</font> This fire can be used whenever fire aura is active, however it only lasts for 1/4th of a second, and requires a large amount of calorie energy. This flame is hotter than the devils fire, but it cannot burn life.<br>
White- This fire makes Yuki as powerful as the collective strength of her opposition, and is activated when she is overwealmed, or when supernatural forces act on her. This is Yuki's strongest flame, however it seems to have negative effects on Yuki after it has run its course.<br>
<font color="Silver">Grey-</font> This flame forms when Yuki is depressed. This flame burns at 500 C, and anyone burned is tormented by what they fear most.<br>
<font color="Black">Black-</font> Black flames are the scariest flames Yuki has, and have never actually been used. They activate if Yuki gives up on the world. It would be smart to kill Yuki if you see this flame.</div>

        <div class="hider" style="display: none;">Unlike angels, these are purified shades. Exactly how these pop up is unknown, as nobody is ever watching when it happens. It is assumed that when a shade that was originally human comes in contact with a holy object they are formed, but there is no real way to validate this claim.<br>
<br>
Anti shades, are called such because there powers are the exact oppisite of shades. Instead of being able to steal souls, they can realease them, along with their body if the soul was stolen while still alive. They also command a good control of light magic, and unlike the slower moving shade, are quite agile. An anti shade will typically fight by manuvering around their opponet until there is an opening. However stronger anti shades can combine light magic with other skills to overwealm their opponet.<br>
<br>
Anti shades are like guardians. They mix in with humans so that they can aviod detection, as anti shades are a large threat to any soul stealers. Anti shades only get one human form, but they can change their age as they see fit. They are bound only by their sense of justice.</div>
    </div>
</div><br>
<br>
Personality: Zekon is pretty typical for an 18 year old. She is slightly arrogant, but because of her disipline with the sword, she will help anyone in need without seeking anything in return. She spends a lot of time meditating, but that has done nothing to tame her teenage spirit. If she spent near as much time studying as she did flirting, she might actually do well in school.<br>
Bio: Zekon was originally born as a shade, which is basically a soul devouring ghost. She spent around 50 years in this form, practicing swordplay. Then she was sent to attack a league of angels, because she was their priced fighter. However 50 seconds into the mission, she was struck with consentrated holy light. Normally this would be the end of a shade, but instead it had a purifying effect. There are some rumor this happened because Zekon was a human before becoming a shade, but regardless she became completely opposite of a shade after the event. <br>
<br>
She took on the name Neo Zekon to reflect the fact that she became something new, but everyone calls her Zekon anyway. Zekon decided to take up defending the world against the shades, and other forms of evil. She heard of a lot of supernatural activity taking place around TJA, so she decided to change her age to fit in better, as well as sign up for some classes. Since joining, she has tried to get a swordplay club started up, but to little avail. She has been working in the dark for a while, but it seems she is about to make a move to defend this school from recent threats.<br>

Age- 14<br>
Esper<br>
Personality- A bit cold, but blossoming into life apon entering conversation. Farron has massive trust issues, and is not emotionally stable. Farron tends to take small offenses to extremes, and is extremely hard on herself when unable to accomplish a task. Farron's most notable personality trait, is that she feels a need to put up a front that seems open and friendly, yet is fairly easy to see through.<br>

        <div class="hider" style="display: none;"> Farron is a mistake. Her mind contains knowledge of how the universe operates, and applying this knowledge, can create massive changes to how things act. Although Farron doesn't have a complete blueprint of the universe, she knows everything there is about relationships between mind and matter. This knowledge allowed her to cheat, manipulate, and outwit adults since age 2. Slowly, but surely, everyone around Farron began to wonder how she accomplished the feats she did, and they all came to the conclusion that she was cursed. <br>
<br>
Although the statement could very well be true, only Farron's parents knew the circumstances surrounding her birth, yet never revealed it to her or another soul. They sent her away to a faraway school, where she might fit in better. Whatever happened when she was born, was worth sending her this far. So now Farron is left to wonder, what could have happened to require her to be sent away from her loving family, without as much as even a word?</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Name: Sin "Insert Shizzload of Aliases from Various Times/Planets/Cultures/etc. Here" Sieben<br>
Age: Chronological: Very Old, Biological: Somewhere in the Teens(sort of lost count a few sequels ago)<br>
Gender: Predominately male, but can decide to go female or any sort.<br>
Race: Diety, not Dietree<br>
Personality: There are a handful of words that can sum up Sin's personality, primarily the words absurd, smartarded, *and selfish, concieted, and arrogant. Of course most of his traits are semi-justified, but, meh. His ability to function normally in society is highly unpredictable, capable of switching between absurdly daft, and extremely ethical(is that he word you'd use? Meh), usually all within the span of an hour or so He lacks many essential things, common sense, the ability to make 'important' decisions, and a sense of shame. All of which he makes up for with his creativity, silliness, and social ability in parties. He also has the ability to make routine plans that would result in something of his choosing, but he usually fogets about it afew stages in. In short he's probably your average diety that thinks he/she/it can do whatever said diety wants.*<br>
History: <b>Thank you Roo for this wonderful masterpiece, especially the following paragraph!</b><br>
*It all started many millions of years ago when Sin created the universe...then some stuff happened and he ended up attending Tenshi Jigoku Academy.<br>
<br>
At the academy Sin found himself in a romantic relationship with the Reaper Princess. However after the Winter break he went missing, only to find that parts of his soul had split up into 5 other gods. Despite this they were able to revive him, if only for a short while, because after returning Sin disappeared, but not before leaving behind a reincarnate/son.*<br>
<br>
By the time he returned from where ever it was that he had disappeared to, the Reaper Princess had already gotten with another man by the name of Locke. His return also brought forth a new mysterious apprentice, of whom little is known about; gender, origin, race...not even his name was known.*<br>
<br>
During the Flordia trip, both Sin's and Locke's realationship with the Reaper came to an end, and he, Locke and Zix spent time drinking and plotting sabotage on the petty Reaper girl. After they returned to the school and Wonderland vanished, Sin rose to the occasion and took up the role of headmaster, recreating the school and essentially taking over.<br>

Name: Yuriko Marioll<br>
Age: Unknown, possibly older than she looks.<br>
Gender: Female<br>
Race: Necromancer<br>
Personality: Yuriko is a quiet one at first glance, though she has a sadistic nature deep down inside. She's also the kind who has a strong belief in fate, not intervening in anything, and sitting on the sidelines unless she feels that fate demands it.<br>
History: Yuriko comes from a long line of Necromancers, some good, some bad. Yuriko is notable for being somewhere in the middle, not being overly heroic, yet not being particularly villainous.

Age: appearance--&gt; 12 to 14 real --&gt; moderately, but unnaturally old<br>
<br>
Gender: Male<br>
<br>
Race: Thunderbird<br>
<br>
Species Background : Huge birds that take on the plummage of any bird and the face and body of a human , capable of causing storm like winds and thunder/lightning with a powerful flap of it's goliath wings, also said to have razor sharp teeth to knaw through meat and other food items.

<br>
<br>
<br>
Personality: A very curious and kind soul, considering Freyr still has so much to discover, you would often see him staring off in the distance with a twinkle in his eye and the smallest twitch of a smile tugging at his lips, not only that but tends to start to absentmindedly walk off, not taking his gaze off something that piques his curiosity. Freyr is not a very social bird, but often doesn’t mind company; he often tries to be a social butterfly as they call it but sometimes begins to mutter to himself the rest of his sentence. As for fighting, he believes that fighting should only take place if he's threatened and not otherwise. He wishes that this was him now... Freyr is no longer the completely pure soul he used to be.... He started to be engulfed in his past and he became bi-polar, moods and personality switch every couple hours... minutes or even seconds. If the situation is happy, Freyr is happy... but when he’s angry or sad... all hell can break loose. The same goes for his outlook on life, when he recalls his past, he just wants to be alone, solitary.To find Freyr, you'd need to search in the highest or most shadowed areas, such as shady lakes and tall trees, and sometimes even abandoned caves will suffice for this curious bird, where he’d either wonder of simply sleep, he also tends to wonder places he shouldn’t go, restricted areas, dangerous places. It’s always about adventure with the boy.<br>
<br>
History:  His father was quite abusive and his mom was constantly ill. He had twin older brothers he loved to the ends of the earth and a little sister who died young because of her mother’s shared disease. There was only one thing left he could possibly do; he and his older brothers ran away. They both work and Freyr goes to school, they barely see each other anymore, but he is very grateful to them for saving him from his once miserable life.<br>
Appearance: yes, yes its cliché anyways..  he sorta looks like this but he has wings that touch the ground and spread out quite wide, because thunderbirds has big wings and such, also his eyes are evergreen like his name  <br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Name: Abrysil Fawns<br>
Age: 17<br>
Gender: Male<br>
Race: Shadow Spinner<br>
Personality: A very quiet, mature boy. He normally talks to himself, and often only talks to others for basic manners, emotional discussion, and to speak out against squabbling - which often causes others to consider him arrogant.<br>
History: Abrysil always went by Abby. He never recognized nomengenetics, and was taught by his father - another Shadow Spinner - that his name was his soul. His mother was always a bit afraid of the both of them, but nevertheless, she loved Abrysil. When his family was killed in a house fire, Abby became quiet. The next day, he went to school and was forced out by a good portion of the student body. He went back to the wreckage of his home and took his father's hooded coat and his shade - a sphere which enabled his powers. The cross around his neck reacted with the shade and glowed for a moment, though Abrysil hadn't found out why for quite some time. He now keeps the cross inside his coat, but still around his neck, after discovering why it glowed.<br>
Appearance: <img src="./106673_files/picture.php" border="0" alt="" onload="NcodeImageResizer.createOn(this);"><br>
Other: The cross reacted with the shadow sphere - the shade - and became a large, lightweight, ornate, golden cross, from which he drew a silver longsword from the long end of the cross, which he grips during combat. Most Shadow Spinners keep a gold cross with them.</div>

Personality: Shy, under confident, anti-social... but strong. She wont hesitate to fight if one is picked.

History: When younger she would always be pulled into trouble by her siblings. She was always a bit weird and would rarely partake in her sister's harassment and seduction of men... and on many occasions she would end up taking the blame and being run out of the villages, sometimes without her sisters... Eventually she got sick of it so she began to travel, making sure to hide her tail, and occasionally seduced men but... found little pleasure in it other than comical... eventually she fell upon this school... and decided to give it a shot (fail history fails?)<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Name: Yelva (yell-bâ)<br>
Age: True: 4 Human appearance: 14<br>
Gender: Female<br>
Race: Silver (some kind of wild cat... probably Serval)<br>
Personality: Quiet, caring, and somewhat pessimistic. Very intelligent and wise. She's also passive and likes to avoid or run away from fights rather than fight in them. She's cautious, but actually very social when people start the conversations...<br>
History: As a kit she was always the weird one, as well as the runt- always bullied by her littermates. Always seen as a stupid failure by her family...<br>
One night she grew sick of it and ran off, barely knowing how to hunt or survive on her own. Because of this, she ended up nearly dying until stumbling upon a very nice, elderly couple that ended up taking care of her for a few years... but it didn't last. Eventually Yelva did something stupid that accidentally set fire to the house... causing her to flee and the couple to die a firey death!<br>
After that she began to creep around human civilizations. One day she stumbled upon a coyote in a fight with another animal and, being cautious and passive, she cowered away from the fight until it ended. After the two creatures had left, she became curious at some kind of liquid on the ground. The liquid... was interesting, and she naively took a lap at it. (Curiosity kills the cat!)<br>
After gaining her new powers, she was extremely confused yet... rather interested in what had happened to her. All she knew was that suddenly she can change into a human- that, honestly, looks like a younger version of her old owners- and that she is able to do and understand a lot more.<br>
Looking for answers, the new Silver wandered upon TJA and... well, doesn't quite know what to expect.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Name:Sean Kabal. "The Fire starter"<br>
Age: 17 Apperence, 97 actual age.<br>
Gender:Male.<br>
Race: Faker (Not sure how I would go into more detail about these unless you want it here).<br>
Personality:Sean is kind and warm hearted, his mother used to say his heart was "warmed by the very flames he controls", he is also a very sneaky person but a flashy person at the same time, he can do things without anyone noticing and other times he will not do something without everybody noticing. He is somewhat over protective of his sister Ida and dislikes people talking down to her. He is always trying to get Ida to be more courageous and speak up for herself.<br>
History:Sean was born into the Kabal clan of Fakers, a clan that was rather in the middle when it came to the Faker trademarks of showing off, flashy behaviour and burning stuff, Sean however has an overly large fixation with setting things on fire and especially likes to set fire to important things that belong to people that are bullies or disrespectful to women in any way, he has no problem making it known that he can set fire to just about anything he can reach and does so with alarming regularity. He likes his food to be hot and his fires hotter but is slightly pacified by his sister Ida who the flip side of him.<br>

Name: Ida Kabal<br>
Age: 13 Apperence/16 Actual.<br>
Gender:Female.<br>
Race: Faker.<br>
Personality:Ida is shy and timid around most people and her voice is soft and hard to hear, she is also scared easily and does not like sudden, loud noises. She will often hide behind her brother when she is scared. She also lacks her brothers skill in controlling fire and obsession for setting things on fire.<br>
History:Ida was born to the Kabal clan of Fakers and tried her best not to stand out as most female Fakers do on there first time though life, she given to Sean of the same clan to look after her since he had already been though one life and was experienced in the ways of the world and how to look after younger people, his rash and impulsive behaviour was a complete turnabout for Ida's shy and quiet personality and so they did not get along very well at the start but Sean has managed to calm himself down when she is around.<br>

Name: Kaede Kabal<br>
Age: 15/175<br>
Gender: Female.<br>
Race: Faker.<br>
Personality: Kaede is ten years shy of being called an Elder in Faker culture. Elder's are people over 150 years old that have re birthed (Died and remade themselves) at least twice, making this the third time Kaede has lived. The third life is usually when Faker's start to mellow and Kaede is no exception, she is confident and knowledgeable, hard to shake and harder to annoy, and possesses great control over her Faker powers but also the maturity of her great age means that she uses it very little, following the Faker saying "The more you know about Faking the less you use it". Over her lives she had gathered the ability to quickly adapt to her social surroundings. She can be kind and generous but also hostile and aggressive depending on the situation. She also has a subconscious way of speaking to people as if they know less than she does, it is born from her great knowledge bank and while Kaede tries to suppress it she can't always keep it down. <br>
History: Kaede's first life was surprisingly uninteresting, most Fakers go a bit wild on their first life but Kaede did not. She was an average girl that led an average life and died an average death. The only part of her life that was of any note was that she spent the entire life gathering knowledge about everything, both first and second hand, by the time of her first death she was as knowledgeable as third-lifers. Kaede had always been greatly interested in all sorts of knowledge, she would spend weeks researching everything there was to learn about a subject before moving onto another one, so when she heard of an academy that was populated by monsters she took the opportunity to expand her knowledge bank.<br>

Age: (Both age appearence and actual age if neccessary) 19<br>
Gender: Female<br>
Race: (You may create your own, but please let me know about this race elsewhere if this is the case) Vampire<br>
Personality: Ori is very very very shy, she will only talk when spoken to, sometimes not even when spoken to. She tries to be a happy and joyfilled person. She pays very well attention in class, but sometimes gets a little distracted, especially when it's time to feed.<br>
History: Orianna was just an average person living an normal life, which she found to be boring. Seeing that she wanted more, one day she visited the library in 'The Forbidden Section', where she found an old, dusy book with a skull on the cover. The book told her she could have amazing powers beyond relief if she followed it's instructions. However, there was a catch. She had to kill her parents and take their hearts. She thought about it on the way to her house. But, someone had already decided her choice. Both her parents her killed, each one by a different 'accident'. Seeing as she had no choice, she took their hearts and followed the instructions in order to complete the ritual. She had been tricked. She had been turned into a vampire.She gained only the slightest of their powers and all their weaknesses. Ori now moved to tokyo, enrolling in Tenshi Jigoku Academy, hoping to gain her full powers.<br>

Personality: Lance is a bouyant, peppy young lad for someone with his past. He is rather talkative and nice to everyone despite their feelings towards him. He is the ultimate optimist.<br>
<br>
History: Lance was once part of the famous/infamous FurLance family. They were trained demon hunters and their skills were incredible. His family included his mother, father and two older brothers. However, one night his eldest brother, Kale, alerted a dwelling of demons of the familys' plans to kill them all. He did this in return for demon blood so that he could become a half-demon. What ensued from there was a bloody ambush. Sarecyn was the only one able to fight his way through the attack. He made it to the main chamber where he found his treasonous brother. They fought an epic battle and Sarecyn came out on top, but not before Kale marked him with a cursed wound on his back. This curse would inflict major pain on its victim everytime he or she killed a demon, and minor pain whenever one died period. In light of this new fact, Sarecyn gave up demon hunting and started going by "Lance." Then he traveled to the Tenshi Jigoku Academy to study and train and work on his social skills.<br>

Personality: Mizurama is quiet young man who is very engrossed in his studies. He usually keeps just a few close friends because he struggles with social interaction and is easily scared by new people, crowds, etc... He wishes more than anything, however, to overcome this fear at the Academy.<br>
<br>
History: Mizurama is a water elemental who was orphaned at a young age. After several years in the orphanage, he took an extreme interest in education and enrolled himself into a small private school, working part time for an old shop owner simultaneously. After a few mishaps in school, he was kicked out and shunned by the village he was living in at the time. His powers were just getting him into trouble. But then he heard of a special Academy designed for people like him, so he decided to check it out.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Name: Alex<br>
Age: 20ish<br>
Gender: Male<br>
Race: Merger<br>
<br>
Personality: He has a very friendly way of behaving, but the closer people get to him the more they realise how distant he is. <br>
<br>
History: <br>
<br>
Waking up in a forest around the age of 5 he has no prior history of his life. He had no abilitity to speak or know anything but learned quickly. Wondering into a village shortly after gaining conciounes he found himself unexplainably shunned until a reflection in a window caught his eye. His skin was all different shades of color as was his hair. Looking like a proper freak he sinked into the shadows. One day leaning against a wall and longing to fit in with the other children he found himself sinking into his thoughts. Then he started to realise it wasn't just his thoughts he was sinking into; it was also the wall he was leaning against!<br>
<br>
Completely submerged he could no longer hear, see, or do anything other than think. Panicing he found himself running out of the wall. Catching his breath he noticed that something was different. The cold winter air could no longer be felt. Looking at his hand he found it was still the same concreat mixture as the wall he just escaped from, as was the rest of his body. The other villagers also took note of this in awe and disgust. He then ran away from the village never to return. <br>
<br>
He lived the next few years of his life in the woods where he learned how to controle his abilities. He would merge with trees, rocks, and even lakes. Once he even tried to merge with fire, but that just resulted in painful burns. His favorite thing to do was holding an animal and then shapeshifting into a copy of it. If he held too long he would even find himself looking through the animals eyes, but that is not appealing seeing as animal thoughts are usualy pretty scatter brained. He also mastered the art of simply changing the pigments of his body into whatever color he desired. Being as though his normal skin tone is a creepy rainbow color, he prefers to use this to look normal. <br>
<br>
Later he grew up and assimilated well with the city that he moved into just as well as he assimilated with nature. By first glance you could never tell that he is quite the freak he is. <br>

<b>Name</b>: <u>Mark Greenfield</u><br>
<br>
[<b>Nickname</b>] - <i>'Camera Face'</i><br>
<br>
<b>Age</b>: 18<br>
<br>
<b>Gender</b>: Male<br>
<br>
<b>Race</b>: Human<br>
<br>
<b>Personality</b>: <i>Mark tends to put his nose in other people's businesses and take photos with a camera. Ironically enough, he does not share his photos with anyone (except for certain moments). He likes to talk with himself for some reason. In a strange sense, he is silent in crowded areas and retarded in private areas.</i><br>
<br>
<b>History</b>: <i>Mark had the usual life-style base of an average student; 'Wake-Up, School, Get In Trouble, Shut Up, Eat, Urinate/Crap, and Sleep'. He liked to socialize with other students and mess up big-time in tests. However, his life was twisted 180 degrees when he decided to try using a camera. Interested by how he could create memories using a single electronic device, he began skipping classes to take photos. He earned the title of 'Camera-Face' in sixth grade.<br>
<br>
Eventually, his father sent him away to an academy so that Mark could actually participate in education before both of his parents died in an airplane crash incident. This turned the 'social man' into an 'anti-social' man. Oblivious to the fact that the place itself was unique, he accepted his fate and enrolled to the academy.</i><br>
<br>
<b>Appearance</b>: <img src="./106673_files/anime_guy_with_black_hair-t2.jpg" border="0" alt="" onload="NcodeImageResizer.createOn(this);"><br>
<br>
<b>Other</b>: - Mark always has the camera slung over his neck. To support it from breaking/falling, he has one hand grabbing the camera.<br>
<br>
- Mark is a black-belt at Taekwondo despite his strange nature. He also used to do Kendo.<br>
<br>
- Mark knows how to use objects around him as weapons, though the ability itself could be useless if they're all useless for combat.<br>
<br>
- Mark has arachnophobia.<br>
<br>
- Mark gets nervous whenever he sees something new. The reason of why he is could vary.<br>
<br>
-Mark likes silent people and tends to suddenly get social before leaving/being left.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Name: Cupid<br>
<br>
Age: 17<br>
<br>
Gender: Male<br>
<br>
Race: Deity (of Love)<br>
<br>
Personality: The angel comes off as a shy and nervous person, often afraid of being made fun of by others by his reputation, either it being good or bad during the time. He is known to, when angered or pressured, to pull of pranks out of pure mischief. He often regrets on these acts, as he goes so far as to make someone fall in love with something absurd, which goes against his guidelines of using his gift of controlling love. What makes him more upset about this, is that he cannot reverse any effects, unless he were to find someone who could reverse the effects of one of his arrows. Other then that, he is a happy go lucky guy, who is always wanting to help everyone. <br>
<br>
History: Cupid is the birthplace of the feeling "Love", and is one of many people that are said to hold up world peace. Of course, this is highly debatable. He has descended to numerous times and places, to have people fall in love with other people, in order to maintain organized peace and population growth in the world. Finding out about a school built for various species and races, Cupid's recent job is to stay near the school and to make people fall in love with other people. To do this though, he had to enroll in the school. He's hoping to make some friends while doing his job. <br>

<img src="./106673_files/honey_sempai_host_club_by_sabocchia.jpg" border="0" alt="" onload="NcodeImageResizer.createOn(this);"><br>
<br>
Other: He has a bow and heart shaped arrows, and shoots arrows at people, which make them fall in love with the next person they see. Sadly though, he is a horrible shot, and should be fired for doing this.</div>

        <div class="hider" style="display: none;"><br>
Mifinik Species: Their a 'me-made' species of aliens, they tend to show traits from both Minks and foxes physically, yeah i'm sure someone is gonna have a dirty idea about that &gt;.&gt; But yeah, the relevant information is below.<br>
<br>
Important Details: They are 'officially' a genderless and asexually reproducing Species, However they are clearly male in appearance, And 'can' breed with other species, often ending up with an amalgamation of both side's genetic traits. There's also a number of randomized traits, such as proportions, physical resistances, muscular strength, internal things seem to be wildly different between each one, though their malleable genetics make it easy for them to adapt to changing environments to survive.<br>
<br>
One ever present traits among Pure-blooded Mifinik's is their tails, Their tails are actually more like another conciousness in their body, though it only controls the tail unless the main body is unconcious. The tail mouth has a mind of it's own, generally is far more blunt than their main body, as well there are many different types of tails, though each generally has rather flexible teeth, so that they can do things without damage, and excessively long tongue, with a mouth as long as your body wouldn't you expect that? some have venom of special fluids in their saliva.<br>
<br>
One of the most important things about the sentient tail is that they and the main body share memories and senses, though both are individual people ultimately, they often work almost flawlessly in tandem, which of course stems from growing up with this 'other person' attached. It is fairly easy to tell which is in control of the body as the voice will change if the tail is in control, they are also capable of swapping places if both of them choose to.<br>
<br>
It's also fairly well known they digest things rapidly and turn it into energy, or can 'turn off' their stomaches to store a meal for later for a burst of energy, Which allows them to go on indefinately without needing sleep, as long as they can get something in their stomach. It's not really proven, but some people theorize that they might be able to live indefinately as well as long as they can eat.<br>
<br>
For the aging, due to their unusual genetics, they can physically reach adult hood after only about 2-10 years, depending on various wild intricacies of their genes, their life-spans are varied as well, anywhere from 50 to 1000's depending both on gene's and how well they manage to keep their body fed and 'alive'.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
History: Their history isn't quite as expansive as such an unusual creature might imply, Nobody really knows where they came from, if they even have a home planet. there's theories that they were 'created' by someone, and that creation simply kept multiplying into a whole species, other's think maybe a whole civilization under-went some genetic modification that caused this species. The most obvious things however are that they grow up 'fast', they love to travel or trade [they make great merchants it seems], and the sheer diversity of their genetics allows them to choose just about anything they want and sculpt themselves into being perfect for that lifestyle.<br>
<br>
They are often found on just about everyplanet, their flexible genetics also making them able to adapt rapidly to strange environments, often changing in ways that are both simple, and unexpected to survive in those places. Hence why some can even be on earth without anyone seeming to know why they're there, though they can be quite dangerous, It's generally known that there is no defineable mentallity for the species, nor required environmental factors or even dietary needs. Of course anyone who knows about them can identify them even if they can't 'see' what they are, as normal humans don't have a second voice coming out of them at random, nor do people complain about a fuzzy thing brushing up against them when someone walks by.<br>
<br>
Of course, as for 'why' they are somewhere? you'll hafta ask em XD their not a hive mind or anything, nor an organized civilization, so everyone has their own reasons.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Name: Katrin Mordenson &amp; Oguchi<br>
<br>
Age: 16  [They don't age the same as humans would =P][In his case he reached physical adult-hood after 5 years.]<br>
<br>
Gender: Male? <br>
<br>
Race: Mifinik<br>
<br>
Personality: He's rather a random person, While not mentally unstable, unless he wants to behave that way, He can show considerably different personalities to different people and in different situations. Not being bound, born, or trained in social norms can cause considerably unusual effects on personality =3 While he does tend to quietly observe when given the chance, as soon as he's involved in something things change, though he does at least try not to make a fool of himself.<br>
<br>
Oguchi on the other hand, Has no morals aside from those of the body It's attached to, Is all too happily to give someone an abrasively blunt answer, or rather honesty, and will occasionally even blurt mental secrets out to torment his 'body' just for fun. He does also tend to be quite shameless in animal like tendencies of licking and sniffing random people, even if Kat's in the middle of a conversation.<br>
<br>
<br>
History: Kat's History? Well, that started when his father got bored and decided to make a son, The process isn't exactly Acceptable by this websites standards for PG material =P Bottom line, he came out looking pretty much like his father, grew up quickly, learned to function as an individual and so on. Of course once he wasn't a little kid anymore, which didn't take long, His father began Teaching him things he knew about his trade, mechanical knowledge, inventive Technology, Weapons dealing, how ot skirt the law, the list goes on, but it only lasted a couple of years before he gave his son a test. now Kat has been deposited on earth, and his 'test' is to learn to blend in and learn everything he can, the more he can report later on the better his 'grade' will be, visiting this particular academy makes for a particularly useful learning experience, especially with all of these other unusual creatures in it's halls.<br>
<br>
<br>
Appearance: He stands at about 7'2", A fairly toned 'size' to himself, though thick fur makes it impossible to see, and Often appears quite black furred, with Various patterns of Forest Green and Red [inplace of white in the picture] mixed in and his eyes oddly perpetually changing colors. His cornea are black, his pupils slitted, and his Irises steadily produce a different color every few minutes.<br>
<br>
as for cloths? who needs em right? I kid, He tends to wear at least shorts that'll keep him decent, though he also has a Technologically enhanced trench-coat that his father built for him that he wears almost all the time.<br>
<br>
The first picture is fitting for his body type and appearance xD differences are obviously listed above. The second is 'just' for the tail, best reference I could find ^.^<br>

Other:<br>
<br>
Disguise?: It will likely take a few encounters for his natural adaptation to complete the process, but his body if in the midst of developing a natural pheromone that will cause humans to see him as entirely human, and even feeling, hear, and smell as if he's human, but only to humans. Other creatures will be capable of seeing him completely normally.<br>
<br>
<br>
Special Stuff about this one: He's developed a few resistances to various natural elements, i.e. fire, pressure, lightning, though not extensive, his body is reactive and when struck by them will temporarily grow more resistant, and it will stack the more often he's hit with it. It's more of a balance situation, resistance to one thing may bring weakness to another.<br>
<br>
His tail creature also happens to have a number of extra little tentacles attached to it's insides, well, a LOT actually, it's inside if lined with stretcheable appendages that can extend farther than the tongue itself.<br>
<br>
The tail-maw's saliva, and his own, is modifiable to have different chemical effects, such as paralysis, caustic, addictive, It depends on what's needed and how long he has to fabricate the needed fluids, though he generally has a godo bit of paralytic ready as a precaution.<br>

R.A.I.D.S.<br>
<br>
Technical name: Reactive Armored Inconspicuous Defense System<br>
Abbreviation: R.A.I.D.S.<br>
Weight: 50 pounds<br>
Average Price: If mass produced, would likely cost upwards of 100 thousand per unit.<br>
<br>
Color: basic color is Black, Reflective Black Green inside, and Red Leather on the various padded locations. Also invluding black leather straps<br>
<br>
Description: From the outside This thing appears to be an average 7 foot long Duster Jacket with a little customization in the form of leather pads covering over both fore-arms, elbows, shoulders, down the spine, and along length of the jacket from the waist down. It also includes black leather straps around the Upper Arms, as well as connecting splits in the lower length of the jacket.<br>
<br>
On the inside there is a system of wiring and nodes that attach to a small power source in one of several places, either on the spine, chest, or waist. this system serves to power small scale reactive plates, the shape's hidden by the leather pads, and causes them to behave like powered armor. it can also be connected to specialized objects, such as powered gloves, armor additions, small tools or gadgets that require little power to run. the casings for the powered plates as armored themselves and able to compensate for impacts that don't require a power source to protect again, and are specially shaped and padded to comfortably fit the user's body, and to prevent possibility of the powered armor back shocking the user.<br>
<br>
Also on the Inside are numerous pockets, slots, straps, and loops that can hold several hidden objects of varying sizes, smallest including pill sized, and larger including, on occasion shotguns, and various multi part rifles.<br>
<br>
Additions: other things can also be used with it, such as hoods, masks, powered varieties of both, connectable gloves or powered blade weapons. it can also fit some larger objects with specialized attachment hooks and straps.<br>
<br>
General Purpose: The R.A.I.D.S. is generally used by it's inventor for flexible self protection in public environments. it can quite literally be used to effectively replace a need for cumbersum armors like kevlar or anti explosive suits, while maintaining greater flexible and the ability to carry multiple tooks and weapons. he's also doing work on a variety of different versions, from less armor with much greater storage space and flexibility to types with larger power sources and new levels of armor coverage and ability to connect larger weapons.<br>

        <div class="hider" style="display: none;"><br>
Useful Elaboration: For those who might be skeptical about the Technologically advanced jacket, or the reactive physical resistances, I'm adding in this section here to detail their limits.<br>
<br>
The Jacket can only have a certain number of attachments in certain places, as well as having a charge level that will drain whenever used, and recharges slowly.<br>
<br>
For instance, if he were to electrify a punch, that would take 5-10% charge depending on how much zap he wanted in the hit, and recharge 1-5% per post depending on various conditions. of course long time periods in one post or time skips increase recharge and such xD<br>
<br>
And to make sure I can't cheat, Here's a list of the locations that can have attachments.<br>
<br>
R/L Arm<br>
R/L Leg<br>
Tail<br>
Back<br>
Neck<br>
Chest<br>
L/R Sides<br>
<br>
I will have a hider under my posts pointing out what is attached where, if it has ammo then the ammount will be listed, and it will denote the ammount of charge currently in the jacket. The Reactive Armor State in certain places will also be listed, but will be added in Resistance section.<br>
<br>
<br>
NOW, for the resistance, He can only develop combat resistances against 'natural' elements, whether it's 'made' artificially or not doesn't matter as long as it can occur naturalls. The resistance base is negligible, and whenever it increases from an attack something else is decreased, making it a rebalancing of durability. The increase rate is from 2 - 30 % depending on conditions. They will also reverse direction at a rate of 1% per post if nothing hits him, or the same 2-30 percent depending on what is used against him.<br>
<br>
NOW, the stronger the attack that hits him, the less affinity he'll gain from it as the more traumatizing it'll be to his body.<br>
<br>
The longer lasting an attack is, the greater affinity he'll gain from it, as a slower dragged on attack allows him plenty of time to naturally adapt to it.<br>
<br>
His appearance 'will' change to reflect these affinities, in some cases it may even debilitate him to have these changes, or it may help, that's a case to case basis and if the GMs don't like what i change i'll unchange it XD He can gain a complete resistance to something, or even absorption abilities, but then would end up with a 2-300% weakness to something else, not to mention a fight would really hafta drag on to get him to that point XD<br>
<br>
NOTE: He can change his affinities manually and long term by using some special device [Which he probably will invent during the course of RP, as such NOT YET.], By attacking 'himself' with i or by finding a fitting environment to spend some time in and adapt to it, such as a very heated area, or a cool forest.`<br>
<br>
I just thought of this, but, once the genetic resistances increase past 50% and up past 100% he can use an 'ability' based on that element, however doing so will cost resistance rather than energy, making him weaker against that element. cost depends on the ability, higher abilities above 100 or 200% will take as much as 50-100% resistance, lower ones maybe 5-30%<br>
<br>
As for the elements involved in this, and his base resistance. Note: Gravity and Vacuum are the only ones that don't 'reduce' something else when they increase, partly due to their rarity, but also they decrease at a 'minimum' rate of 5%, though up to 50% depending on the environment or what he might do with these affinities. NOTHER NOTE: Gravity does NOT include the natural gravity of a planet, he will not randomly grow stronger just from being there, though falling a good distance will coutn for this.<br>
<br>
Fire: 10%<br>
Water: 10%<br>
Lightning: 10%<br>
Wind/Force: 10%<br>
Gravity/Pressure: 20%<br>
Vacuum: 20%<br>
Poison: 100%<br>
Acid: -100%<br>
Regeneration: 100%<br>
Medicine: -100%<br>
<br>
little explaination: Poison is 100% becuase he can create his own, he needs to be immune to it or he'd just kill himself, Though adapting to acid will make even his natural poisons project their own effects on him, so he'll basically be unable to use them until it levels back out. He also has high physical regeneration, however medical attention/chemicals and such will not only disrupt this temporarily but cause him serious physical pain. This includes sedatives or even headache pills. [think of it as a severe allergy to man made medicine XD<br>
<br>
<br>
Reactive Armor: these do not give him Genetic abilities when above 50%<br>
Impact: 10%<br>
Pierce: 10%<br>
Slash: 10%<br>
Explosion: 10%<br>

<br>
Name: Tewi Sig'relm<br>
<br>
Age: 17<br>
<br>
Gender: Female<br>
<br>
Race: Demonic Celestian<br>
<br>
Personality: Extremely introverted. Faints when placed in stressful situations. She keeps to her self a great deal of the time. She tries to avoid any if not all contact with living things in fear of harming them.<br>
<br>
History: <br>
<blockquote>She's a fallen Celestian. She was recently dropped from the heavens for being inherently the child of a Celestian and a Demon who found the Heavens. Her wings, as opposed to a normal Celestian's white or golden hue, are a tainted jet black. Her eyes are a result of being Demon born as well. The Celestians saw this as a blight on their perfect hidden world so her Demon father and her Celestian mother were 'purged'. A purge is the equivalent of Execution in Celestian society. One is prodded with a mark of shame, then has his or her wings chained. He or she is then thrown from the sky from a place that is far away from the Heavens. She was for several years chastised for being a demon spawn, living under the pressure, bigotry, and hate coming from her own people. All of this caused her introversion. She knows nothing, but fear and insecurity. Seventeen years of these feelings have beaten compliance and a weak constitution into her. Seventeen years later, she is Purged; she lands straight in the center of TJA.</blockquote>Appearance: <br>
<blockquote>Her skin is a pale white. Red emotionless eyes adorn her face. Black feathery wings. Light brown flowing hair tied in a knot that falls to her back. Her face has soft features and is often disarming despite her eyes standing out so clearly.</blockquote><div align="center"><table class="ncode_imageresizer_warning" id="ncode_imageresizer_warning_68" width="651"><tbody><tr><td width="20" class="td1"><img src="./106673_files/wol_error.gif" width="16" height="16" alt="" border="0"></td><td class="td2">This image has been resized.

Clothing: <br>
<blockquote>Before being thrown to earth, she was dressed in black demonic clothing to symbolize her as a blight on Celestian society. </blockquote>Ability:<blockquote><br>
+ Flight: She can fly, but not very adequately. Her wings are still healing from being chained. Her best use of wings is to glide slightly over the earth.<br>
<br>
+ Demon's eyes: Can turn them on whenever she sees the need to. They grant her a small portion of Demon abilities like warping a short distance, summoning chains from hell, or at worst opening a gate to hell. (Assuming she's spilled enough blood where she wants to open the gate)<br>
<br>
+ Faded Existence: Stemming from her demon eyes, Tewi can temporarily fade away. It is as though she is invisible, but even if someone where to walk where she would be standing, they would not feel anything.<br>
<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic"><div align="center"><b><u>Name:</u></b> <font color="DarkOrchid"><b>Ayane Takeda</b></font> aka <font color="MediumTurquoise"><b>Yukidama</b></font><br>
<b><u>Age:</u></b> 17 - in Appearance / 127 - Actual Age<br>
<b><u>Gender:</u></b> Female<br>
<b><u>Race:</u></b> Noble/Pure-Blooded Elemental<br>
<br>
<b><u>Personality:</u></b> Ayane has a Ambivalent personality, meaning she is both out going and shy. She is conscientious but is also considerably loud at times. She is excessively optimistic and naïve, sometimes rushing into things head first. She also tends to be a bit cynical and dwindle during interactions with others. Ayane tends to be abnormally shy when it comes to a guy that she likes and will end to do some weird things. As an Elemental, Ayane can be dull, cold and pretty much heartless to those that annoy her or disrespect her in anyway. This is also due to her element, being a Ice Elemental means that being mean comes natural to her.<br>
<br>
<b><u>History:</u></b> Ayane was born on another plane where the Elementals call home. She is an Ice Elemental 10th Generation in her family. Ice Elementals normally schooled themselves on their own plane due to them mostly being a cold-hearted element that if disrespected in the mortal plane, they would cause massive amounts of damage or even sen them back to the Ice Age. Ayane's knew something was different about herself when she learned of the mortal plane and made a vow that she would prove that both Ice Elementals and mortals could stand by each other is harmony. With this she decided to enroll her in a mortal school.<br>
<br>
During her elementary years of schooling, Ayane wasn't about to control her powers and ended up freezing a lot of children on the playground one day. Those kids shunned, made fun of, and even threw things at her for it. With this Ayane's full uncontrolled power came forth a froze the entire school. Ayane ended up being schooling herself again until she learned to control her power and matured a bit. 5 years later Ayane returned and resumed her public school life. She ended up making a great deal of friends, proving that she was right. Eventually Ayane made her way to Tenshi Jigoku, as her heard that it was a school where both mortals and beings like herself freely attended without fear of anyone shunning them for the powers they were born with. <br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Name : Steffi Larizt<br>
<br>
Age : Appears 22, is actually 112<br>
<br>
Gender : Female<br>
<br>
Race : Guardian. (Guardian affiliation currently being figured out o.o)<br>
<br>
Personality : Has multiple, split personalities, always switching between personalities. To give detail about the personalities, all depends on the situation going on around her. Example, if there's a fight next to her, her personality will relate to who ever side she chooses. If there is a competition nearby, she will become overly competitive, and if a sad moment happens, she too, will become sad<br>
<br>
History : Steffi was just a normal girl, in a semi-peaceful world. When she was chosen to be a Guardian, she quickly replied yes when they asked if she wanted to be one. After her ceremony she was told to be her own, meaning to be unique. She did just that, having her powers, and that marvelous thing on her back, she was completely unique. And like all Guardians, she was given a second form, except from her multiple split personalities, her form was split to 3 stages, the last stage being the true and final form. The stability of each form get worse as she gets closer to the final stage.<br>
<br>
Appearance : Main form - <table class="ncode_imageresizer_warning" id="ncode_imageresizer_warning_67" width="316"><tbody><tr><td width="20" class="td1"><img src="./106673_files/wol_error.gif" width="16" height="16" alt="" border="0"></td><td class="td2">Click this bar to view the full image.</td></tr></tbody></table><img src="./106673_files/demongirl.jpg" border="0" alt="" onload="NcodeImageResizer.createOn(this);" id="ncode_imageresizer_container_67" height="451" width="316"><br>
(Minus the pike she's holding. She can choose to wear that that thing on her back if she wants, all depends on how she's feeling)<br>
<br>
Other : Secondary form stages - <br>
<br>
Stage 1;<br>
Looks - <table class="ncode_imageresizer_warning" id="ncode_imageresizer_warning_71" width="384"><tbody><tr><td width="20" class="td1"><img src="./106673_files/wol_error.gif" width="16" height="16" alt="" border="0"></td><td class="td2">Click this bar to view the full image.</td></tr></tbody></table><img src="./106673_files/darkanimeangel2.jpg" border="0" alt="" onload="NcodeImageResizer.createOn(this);" id="ncode_imageresizer_container_71" height="451" width="384"><br>
Adds - Is granted a sword that all Guardians get, added flying ability, and control over anything metal, aritficial, and all things energy. Tuned up resistances to all elements, and slight tuning up of all other resistances<br>
<br>
<br>
Stage 2;<br>
Looks - <img src="./106673_files/6-Red-Angel-Anime-Girl--67258.jpg" border="0" alt="" onload="NcodeImageResizer.createOn(this);"><br>
Adds - Basic guardian sword morphs to a priest guardian sword, capable of slicing through the toughest of materials like a hot knife through butter, flying ability stays, and is given control over half the known elements in the world. More tuning up of resistances<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Stage 3(also final stage);<br>
Looks - <img src="./106673_files/392199.jpg" border="0" alt="" onload="NcodeImageResizer.createOn(this);"><br>
Adds - The preist sword melds with her wings, and thus, her wings turn metallic, they do not flap like normal wings, but still grant her flight, but a break neck speeds, passing sonic, super sonic, ultra sonic, and mega sonic barriers. She controls all elements, and is granted power to control nearby cosmic forces (ie. comets, asteroids, meteors, even the solar flaring of the sun). Heavy tuning up of resistances<br>
<br>
She is here to pratice her skills, and tame herself. Her stages are controled mentally, but she cannot hold her 3rd stage for long, for it is still highly unstable for her. Her most stable stage is stage 1, and slightly unstable stage is stage 2.</div>

<b><u>Name</u></b><br>
Miranei Corvis<br>
<br>
<b><u>Age</u></b><br>
Unspecified but appears to be in her late teens<br>
<br>
<b><u>Gender</u></b><br>
Female<br>
<br>
<b><u>Race</u></b><br>
Dhampyr<br>
(Offspring of a Vampire and a Human)<br>
<br>
<b><u>Personality</u></b><br>
Miranei tends to keep to herself and has been often described as stand offish. She protects herself first and foremost and thinks lowly of people who act unintelligent.<br>
<br>
<b><u>History</u></b><br>
Miranei grew up in a town where Dhampyr women were meant to be nothing more than whores for Vampire men. She revolted against the idea and became an assassin for the men who tried to prey on the unwilling Dhampyr women.<br>
<br>
After a brief period, she became unable to continue defending herself against the hordes that were now looking for her. She fled and has ended up here.<br>
<br>
Being that her kind has been oppressed (at least, where she was from), she has little formal education and yet, is surprisingly intelligent.<br>
<br>
<b><u>Appearance</u></b><br>

<br>
<b><u>Other</u></b><br>
Because she is only half Vampire, the UV Rays from the sun do not affect her at all. She can sustain herself off of human foods but, will eventually need to feed to survive.<br>
<br>
She carries two daggers on her at all times, strapped at her thighs. <br>
<img src="./106673_files/kit-rae-nasek-the-serpent-dagger.jpg" border="0" alt="" onload="NcodeImageResizer.createOn(this);"><br>
<br>
She is very quick and agile naturally. As for her abilities, she can manipulate most liquids and is currently experimenting with manipulating the blood of her foes.<br>

History: Alyx never knew his parents. His whole life he was raised by another of his kind who belived one day the world would come to a great war and that they would have to fight like all others. He trained Alyx day and night how to wield swords and magic. Both of them gained many scars from their training but bore them valiantly, but one day they were attacked by some unknown beings in the shadows. They killed his trainer who told him to run...but he didn't. He stayed and fought until he was struck from behind, he woke up a while later with 2 long scars on the left side of his face to show for the fight. Not knowing why he was still alive he decided he needed for the first time to leave his home and seek out somewhere else to complete his training, he avoided all civilization until he met a mysterious person who sold him something to hide what he was. Using this he quickly found out about the academy and thought this would be an almost perfect place to continue training and carry on his trainers will...<br>

    <div>
        <div class="spoiler" style="display: none;"><b>Name:</b> Eve Leary, but most people don't even know her name, causing them to refer to her as "that crazy punk girl who plays the guitar"<br>
<br>
<b>Age: </b> Appears over 18 years old, her actual age is unknown, but she is under 200 years old. <br>
<br>
<b>Gender:</b> Female<br>
<br>
<b>Race:</b> Ongaku- (Japanese romaji for music, how <i>creative!</i> -.-)<br>
<br>
The Ongaku are a race formed by a birth between an elf and a demon, or merely two Ongaku.  They appear human apart from their strangely colored eyes and not very commonly appearing elf ears.  The Ongaku retain more characteristics from their demon parent, but inherit the spiritual energy of their elf parent.  This causes them to often be very intelligent, very good at magic, and attached to nature.  They always, however, have enhanced hearing and are gifted when it comes to music.  <br>
<br>
Each Ongaku has a specific song that unlocks their power, it typically isn't learned until they are about four centuries old.  They must keep this song to themselves, and anyone who knows their song is able to hold power over them.  When they first play their song, they are able to fully control their magic, which before that point, is immature and difficult for them to control. <br>
<br>
Another slightly important detail about the Ongaku is that each one is very susceptible to mental disorders and it's very common among them, regardless of how intelligent they are.  It's simply hereditary.   <br>
<br>
The Ongaku are a very temperamental race, and it is wise not to even slightly anger one.<br>
<br>
(Ahh . . . I hope that that's good enough . . )<br>
<br>
<b>Personality:</b>  As a result of being an Ongaku, Eve is prone to mood swings.  Loud by nature, she is a very sarcastic person whose opinion will not be easily swayed.  If provoked, she won't hesitate to stab or try to stab someone.  She is passive-aggressive, causing her to most of the time procrastinate, not trust people, and make excuses for her failure.  As she is a perfectionist, she also uses these excuses to verify her mistakes in her own mind.  She can't stand going a long time without moving, and if she is standing still, will often twitch.<br>
<br>
She is not, by any means, a natural leader, but will make sure her opinion gets heard by the leader of a group.  Eve always has her MP3 player with her, a gift she received from a human friend, and if you were to look at the music within, you would find a variety of music, ranging from Classical with Chopin to Punk with the Sex Pistols to J-Pop and J-Rock with L'Arc-en-Ciel and Yellow Magic Orchestra.  As you can see, she enjoys human music.    <br>
<br>
If you are able to worm into receiving Eve's trust, then you must be a truly gifted person.  To the few people that she trusts, Eve will tell her name, as she refuses to reveal her name at first.  She is actually genuinely sweet and caring to this minority of people, but like it has been stated, it takes a lot to reach this status with her. <br>
<br>
       <br>
<br>
<b>History:</b>  Eve's parents are both Ongaku, she is not one of the "originals," as the Ongaku call the ones born from a demon and an elf.  Her and her parents always lived as humans, and Eve didn't even know she was an Ongaku apart from noticing her abilities and her strangely colored eyes.  <br>
<br>
Eve's parents seemed perfectly nice to others, but they had anger problems and simply chose to take their anger out on Eve.  This coupled with the fact that Eve was tormented in normal human schools for her appearance and for "being weird" led to a kind of traumatic childhood.  <br>
<br>
She didn't get along with most humans, and she only had one friend, another outcast, and his name was Charlie.  Charlie actually got along with people, but aligning himself with Eve automatically caused him to be a target for bullies.  Charlie was the one who gave Eve the MP3 player, and she has treasured it since he gave it to her. <br>
<br>
It was when she was in high school when everything began to hit the fan.  Eve was getting along with her parents less and less, and Charlie was falling into a spiral of depression.  The two were beginning to drift apart, and the wall was solidified when they got into a fight about something pointless.  Eve later went over to his house to apologize, but was greeted by several police cars investigating a fresh suicide.  Eve was distraught, and returning home, began being hassled by her parents, and she decided that she couldn't take it anymore, and began to leave.  This is when she learned about her race, and decided to stay.<br>
<br>
A few days later, she left, as she re-contemplated her decision to stay and figured that it would be a better decision to leave.  Eve went to a train station and found some people shooting drugs, and they convinced her to take some.  She doesn't remember much after that, the next thing she remembers is waking up in TJA.<br>

Cree had a run in with Dark, who had just been dropped on her ass by Belphegor. Seeing as Dark was even more hyper than even Nox and Pluto, Cree walked off on her.<br>
<br>
Avin went up to his own room and met his roommate, Chizuru. The two got aquainted, before running down to see the cause of an explosion...<br>
<br>
Yanamari of course immediately flew down the halls, disregarding that there was supposed to be some sense of secrecy, and Hotaru naturally followed behind her, tearing up again as usual. Yanamari made her way to the dorm Nami had settled into and blow up the door, which was the explosion Chizuru and Avin had run down to see. Shadow came down to investigate as well, yelling at Hotaru and Yanamari before helping Nami, who nearly fell out a window from the explosion. Of course, being yelled at made Hotaru start to cry, but it just got Yana fired up and she was about to fight Shadow when he decided to teleport out of there. Pissed, Yanamari stormed off, leaving behind Hotaru. Once Hotaru had pulled herself togther she realized Yana had wandered off and ran off to find her. Avin and Chizuru went to go get food.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Lone and Viva came in through the window, so Lone could avoid the temptation of flirting with all the student boys. Unfortunately they got seperated and Viva ran off to find her, bumping into Saturos on the way. Saturos offered to help her and the two have been looking for Lone while getting quite friendly <img src="./106673_files/gJeVa.gif" border="0" alt="" title="Wink" class="inlineimg"><br>
<br>
Hotaru was left in a hallway, rather exhausted after running to find Yanamari...<br>
<br>
Yanamari is looking for a fight...<br>
<br>
Bright and Amachi were talking about where Bright has been for a while, between what happened at the end of TJA3 and now, and they were just about to go out for a meal when Dark mosied her way into thier room.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Starting from what I left off in the last summary...<br>
<font color="DeepSkyBlue"><br>
So Anarchy was left alone with Cree after Kyouki ran off to the library. Cree was about to interogate Anarchy about her master(Ludwig) when Anarchy suddenly ditched because she decided Cree was boring.*<br>
<br>
Once Kyouki got to the library since clearly she has no life outside of books she complained to her mentor(Ahira) about her roommate(Anarchy) and begged him to let her room with him, which she declined.<br>
<br>
Kyurai sent one of his familiars out to scan the school grounds for the most rapable girls. In the process, Hanta(the familiar) had an encounter with the Whoopi Goldbergy cougar teacher, Lone. Mainly Hanta just got angry that Lone had such nice breasts and ended up groping her alot, but ended up leaving her alone in the cafeteria.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile Hotaru was falling asleep in the hallway after having tried to hunt down Yanamari with no prevail. She was eventually found by Raiko and the two exchanged greetings for a while until they were greeted by Avin and Chizuru. Raiko, being the dog he is, instantly began to growl and bark at the neko girl(Chizuru), and ended up with her instinctively jumping out a window onto a high tree branch. Raiko chased her onto the branch but she was saved when Kyo teleported her away. In exchange Kyo wanted her to befriend his sister.<br>
<br>
Bright and Amachi discussed what Noah was doing there, and Bright informed Amachi that Noah's collar was the same as her's was and that she was highly suspect. Nevertheless Noah still roamed free, tagging alongside the couple. Eventually they were drawn outside as in a big entrance that included 8-bit carnival music and rainbow commets and marshmellows raining from the sky (and a guest appearance by the intense double rainbow) Zix appeared before them in her usually amusing way, bothering Leru quite some and sending Yanamari on a spree to eat all said marshmellows. Suddenly she turned herself un detectable to all but Amachi, who ahe warned about Belphegor's impending invasion of doom.<br>
<br>
While walking away from watching the spectacle Lone bumped into Lucied, an evil character who wanted help finding some people in the school. lone brought him to hee room to give him a list of all the room numbers and residents, but his visit was cut short when he tried to get Lone to reveal her race. Obviously Lone is not proud of her kind, for she "ran off" in a sense, leaving Lucied to carry on his search. Shortly after he wound up meeting Viva, who accompanied him on his way to Saturos's room. She was told Saturos was a friend of Lucied's, but when she arrived at the door she caught on that for some reason Lucied seemed to be one to be feared.<br>
<br>
Anarchy grabbed Koza and led him to her room telling him she just wanted his help decorating her room. Unfortunately for our furry friend her definition of decorating includes painting the walls red with your victim's blood, so she unexpectedly attacked him.<br>
<br>
Latooni met up with Cree in the library and got aquainted. Not much happened between the two, as Cree was focused on her book of mythical races, but Latoonia did reveal some of her's and her brother's past, including that they were two of the few angels left in existance. Cree ended up disappearing once again.<br>
<br>
A new student entered(Xirea), plaguing the entire school with thousands of spiders, and he made quite a commotion as he began to pummel and unwanted caress the walls of the hallway...that is until Leru came around, not pleased with such vile behavior. Xirea natually took this like a true ass and taunted Leru before going off down th halls, planting more spiders. Leru headed back to his room to find his roommate, Ryusei(AKA Evil Amachi). Ryusei got excited when Leru told him he knew where Amachi was, and the two have started exchanging plans.<br>
<br>
Yanamari was walking the halls bored when she was greeted by Serena with a punch to the face. Of course being the rambunctious ninja she was, Yana gladly returned the favor and the two found themselves in a hand-to-hand combat brawl as they got aquainted. After both sides took a good beating Serena left to attend to her video games.<br>
<br>
After Raiko had fallen off the branch he had chased Chizu onto Hotaru ended up going "beast mode" to catch him, which involved bursting through the wall of the second floor. Once both were safe on the ground they found that they were roommates and went to Shurai's to a great movie decor for thier room, since she has a huge collection due to the fact thier(Raiko and Shurai's) family is rich. After grabbing enough, the couple was about to leave when Yana obnoxiously popped in.<br>
<br>
After Zix had taken leave, Amachi and Bright caught up with Noah who had begun to piss off a rather murderous Bhalhaelo. Amachi took her out of harms way, much to Bright's quite obvious dismay, and the three stuck together until some strange woman from the 4th dimension appeared, introducing herself as Root. They sent Noah off while the couple talked to the woman, though apparently even Bright was overwhelmed by Root's presence, which was revealed to be because Root is an equivilant of God.<br>
<br>
Yet another new student entered the school; a crossdressing phoenix by the name of Blair. After getting in his room and showering he bumped into Shadow and the two have been getting aquainted.<br>
<br>
The characters Clause and Fyla also entered he school. Clause had to wait quite some time just to be shown his room, and shortly after resting he stepped out to wander the halls, finding Keiko in the process. Clause and his phantom announced they were lost, and when Keiko admitted she was as well the three walked about and found Fyla, asking her for her help. Fyla called upon her Djinn and has yet to answer the initial question.<br>
<br>
Lone was on her way to finish setting up her classroom when she spotted Xirea, who had been sleeping in the hallway standing straight up and eyes open. After a rather disgusting spider-filled awakening, Lone offered to help show him the way to the cafeteria, in which he accepted, following behind her while riding a hoard of creepy crawly arachnids.<br>
<br>
Noah had been playing about outside when she met Locke. Naturally she befriended the foxboy, and he seemed to show a certain interest for her collar and her connection to Zix. He invited her to her room moments later, which she ended up coming to via interdimensional rift.<br>
<br>
Gilberta and Karmelia showed up in front of the school. After managing to shake off Karmelia, Gilberta headed for the school while Karmelia headed to the roof to greet a rather disturbed Kyurai before heading into the school.<br>
<br>
Chizuru and Avin met up with Latooni, who turned out to be Kyo's sister, much to Chizu's surprise. The three found out Latooni and Avin had been summoned to the school under unusually similar circumstances...though both decided it best to shrug the matter off.</font></div>

The morning of the newest Tenshi Jigoku Academy's second day started pretty laid back. Up on the rooftop Kyo met the demoness Lunaria, which much to eachothers surprise was actually a friendly encounter. In the school, Locke attended his duties as usuall, dressing in female apparell. Students begin to wake up and head to the cafeteria. Seems like an normal day...<br>
<br>
But this is Tenshi Jigoku. Normal doesn't exist.<br>
<br>
After thier encounter with Lucied the day before, Chizuru first awoke with worry, feeling there was something suspicious. Her thoughts were cut short when Lunaria, fresh fromthe roof, leaped into Chizuru and Avin's room, causing quite a confusion for the pair. Much to Chizu's dismay, the demoness runs off before Chizuru can get a word in. How rude!<br>
<br>
Meanwhile on the roof Kyo is threatened by the incubus Kyurai, who is not pleased to see Kyo or his kind on the roof he's occupied for so long. He does not hesitate to threaten Kyo should the boy not leave.<br>
<br>
Two arrivals come in at this time. Ari wanders aimlessly around the school, so desperate to find where to go that he actually asks one of Fyla's crazy djinns for directions! Mal pulls up in a hearse driven by Jason Nirvana. Upon arrival the mischevious mage slices the tires and skips into the school. Jason is none to pleased to be stuck at TJA, nor is he too pleased that Mr Nirvana's car got damaged.<br>
<br>
Screaming girls can be heard at this point, as Xirea absentmindedly struts his stuff in one of the girl's shower rooms. Elroy immediately takes action, giving the boy a detention, not that the arachnomancer seems to know what that means. While Elroy goes to erase the traumatized girls memories Locke takes over, starting by spraying Xirea with a facefull of supernatural pesticide, which in turn causes Xirea to <i>literally</i> hack up the spider queen. Dallaque is unamused, but the fact Xirea hadn't acknowledged her sooner pissed her off even more, so she beat up on him. After she was off, Locke took over, demanding Xirea gets some goddamn clothes on. With the help of the spiders' weaving, Xirea got clothed, only to run off after a certain kitten-like familiar, leaving behind an extremely aggravated Locke.<br>
<br>
Though in truth said familiar, we'll call her Karmellia, was busy meeting up with the young angel Latooni, offering a contract as per usuall.<br>
<br>
After cooling down over breakfast, Chizuru and Avin walk down the halls only to cross paths with Keiko, exhausted from a paranoid lack of sleep. Even with her odd aura the pair invite Keiko to rest in thier room. About to leave they run into none other than LUNARIA...again. Chizu is not particularly happy to see the demonness again, but is more concerned about Keiko, so she sends Lunaria to find where Keiko's room is while they lay the child to rest.<br>
<br>
Evidently Norah and Noah had spent the night together happily; the two observers seemed to have become clise friends. So who better to come in and ruin things than Zix? <img src="./106673_files/00vlY.gif" border="0" alt="" title="Big Grin" class="inlineimg"> Along with Belphegor, Zix comes to Norah and Amachi's room, greeted by a hug from her overly cheerful "daughter". It doesn't last too long, as it is terribly difficult to hug with one arm, and that's all Noah was left with after Belph sliced it off before stabbing her in the face. Norah watched the entire thing, restrained from being of any help. Eventually she is able to get to Belph, and through a portal the two go to have a grand offscene battle.<br>
<br>
Noah's body vanished.<br>
<br>
In a hallway someways off, a herd of Tyranasaurus-Alpaca-Dolphin-Lions were stampeding in a frenzy, carrying a small rather manic young woman. Trying and succeeding to make an epic enterance, the females victory was cut short when her face met the wall and she was knocked off the bizarre stampede. Ryusei, having seen her fall ran over to check out whether or not she was alright; Clearly a mistake on his part since the woman would not leave his side thereafter as she introduced herself as Lodeca, stradled his back and demanded he carried her to her sister. However the pair's travels were cut short when Noah - or rather something that resembled her <u>exactly</u> - comes forward with an interesting proposition. This Noah claimed that they wished to erradicate the school of Norah Bright, and for this reason she would be more than happy to help Ryusei get to Amachi.<br>
<br>
Norah, having come back from her fight against Belphegor, appears before Amachi in mourning. Confused as ever, Amachi tries to figure out what has happened when a rather threatening knock at the door interupts him. As he opens it he is greeted by Locke, who gives his condolences on Noah's death. Amachi, having not realized Noah was dead to begin with asks the fox-tailed crossdresser to come back at a later time while he talks to Norah. Though she doesn't go into detail, she tells Amachi what had occured and tells him she feels responsible for Noah's death. She vows vengence on Belphegor.<br>
<br>
While wandering about the hallways by her lonesome, Lone meets Kyo who offers to walk with her. Though she is exhausted and out of energy due to the lack of "nutrition" she got the night prior, Lone pulls herself together and feigns a friendly appearence as she accompanies him. They make small talk as they walk to Tenshi Jigoku's grand library, and neither seem to notice the incubus stalking them. Upon arrival at the library the two are joined by a familiar face; Lucied seems happy to see them both, though Lone seems to be oblivious that Kyo doesn't seem as thrilled. Just then the incubus, Kyurai, steps forward, wishing to have a word with Lone. After the two walk out for a midday rendezvous in the woods, Lucied makes his move, immobilizing Kyo with some sort of shadow tentacles. He admits to Kyo he was the one who sent for Latooni and him to come to TJA so Lucied could "end the war". He then kills Kyo in a gruesome fashion, leaving the angel's corpse on the library floor.<br>
<br>
Immeadiately, Latooni can sense her brother's presence disappear.<br>
<br>
Before leaving, Lucied is given several detentions by Vice Headmaster Elroy, who then scoops up Kyo's body and tosses it in a dumpster. Shortly after, Anarchy, who had run off on Mal, broke down the library doors, suddenly hungered by the scent of a slaughter.<br>
<br>
Saturos and Viva cross paths once again, and the two decide to take a romantic trip through one of TJA's various gardens. Mid-kiss, they are dropped in on by Lucied, who <i>requested</i> a private conversation with Saturos. While she had trusted him prior, Viva was begining to understand Lucied was not as charming as he had seemed, and was not eager to leave Saturos alone with him. But Saturos assured her it was for the best, and after wishing him farewell she left.<br>
<br>
The latest student to arrive, though human, was just as unnatural as the rest. Ash walked into Tenshi Jigoku a nervous wreck, weary about starting out at the gargantuan institute. Seeing the nervous new student, Locke - who had changed into more masculine apparell - happily went over to welcome her and see if she would need any assistance. Unfortunately it hadn't crossed his mind she might have been an unknowing human, which she just happened to be, and so the instant Ash caught sight of his fox ears and tail the secret was out. Since there was really no point in trying to hide the supernatural atmosphere this school was infamous for, Locke instead offered to escort her and answer any questions she had. And this might have led to a nice chance for the two to socialize like civilized folk...had Sin not shown up. First the catboy diety Mother Teresaed on about how Sin didn't friend him on some site called RoleplayerGuild and then he went on to offer Ash some Kuntucky Fried Penguin, which he assumably got in the Antartic where Luddy and Nev were freezing thier asses off. Not the least bit content with Sin's antics, Locke sliced Sin's hand clean off, which unfortunately just gave Sin more means to torment Ash with.<br>
<br>
When these two do finally get away, they...or more specifically Ashram...is a great movieed at by the school's one and only Rhornaqubh, Bhal. And man did she look hungry. Locke was about to give her a throatful of knife should she not release Ash, but that plan sort of backfired when Bhal chewed up the weapon and spat it out in a rather phallic shape. Then she left them alone, which was great! Until Sin showed up, startling Ash so much that she ended up punching him in the eye...socket....<br>
<br>
Outside, Yanamari meets Blair. Though the two don't seem to get along at first - namely because Blair couldn't stand that Yana was not only an arrogant, reckless ass but was also completely open about it - the two found a sort of common ground as they told eachother more about themselves. Yana seemed enthralled with the concept of a Platinum Phoenix, while Blair was quite interested in the strange jid carrying the hearse that Yanamari mentioned. And thus the two set out to find the weird super-strong emo kid.<br>
<br>
Lunaria came and went before Keiko woke up, leaving Avin and Chizu with her room number. After having slept a few hours Keiko awoke with a start, accidently making all the glass in the room shatter instantaniously. As Chizuru is making sure everyone is unharmed the god of order appeared in a unconvincing Australlian janitor get up, complete with a fake moustache. "Could things get any more confusing and wierd???" Avin and Chizu were probably wondering, and Luddy was quick to answer with a random smokebomb "Yes! Yes they can!". Before the smoke cleared Ludwig set off an explosive in the "janitor's" direction, pretty much destroying Avin and Chizu's room and splattering poor Nevermore all over the walls in the process. Chizuru decided at this point it would be best for the trio to just GTFO, and so they did.<br>
<br>
And then we're back to Locke and Ash, the latter of which has fainted when suddenly Zix appears! Locke knew of course the meddling observer could be up to no good, but Zix was cryptic as always. Before Zix could zip out through another portal, Locke asked if he could tag along. After all he had been quite curious as to where these portals she was always going in and out of led to, and on top of that he really wanted to get the hell away from Sin. With Zix's approval he jumps through the portal and experiences some serious gently caress your chest hairing nyanning before ending up in a field-like place. He only gets a few moments to look about before the toothy menace, Bhal, shows up once again. Apparently her race also originated from the fourth dimension, though Locke didn't have alot of time to think about that before he was fighting knife-to-fang against the crazed female. After putting on a good show, Bhal mentioned she was having "fun", which cheered Locke up a bit as he came to the conclusion she wasn't so much a major threat as she was just a playful psycho. He threw her a knife, which she immediately gobbled up. While she was feeding, Locke turns his attention to his observer companion, whose original body is lying dormant on the ground while her male form, Vix is alive and present. Bhalhaelo, not patient enough to wait for the fox and the observer to finish thier conversation, lunges at Locke with a giant fork she seemed to pull out of her ass eager to "play" some more. Then Tamaro appeared, at the worst of times really, because just a minute afterwards Bhal scurried over to the unconcious Zix, ate her entire body whole and basically "absorbed" her...and her powers. And even though Zix's mind was still present in the new Zixhaelo, it was Bhal's insanity that dominated. Once again a fight breaks out between the fox and the now all-powered rhornaqubh, only this time it ends with Locke being sent through a mindunwanted caress portal back to his own dimension.<br>
<br>
The tunnel of mindgently caress your chest hair opened up in the same place where Locke had began; the same hallway where he had left Ash lying unconcious. Being slightly deranged himself, Locke was uneffected for the most part by the mindgently caress your chest hairing Zixhaelo had put him through, and honestly he was more concerned about the amulet he had accidently left behind. Vix, who came out shortly after Locke, assured him that his other half - the one still alive within Zixhaelo - hadn't discovered the amulet, though without it Locke was still left in his full out anthro form. However, he had little time to worry about that before a familiar face caught his eye, and without even considering Vix or Ash he ran off to greet his old friend Nian as well as her cousin, Lada. The two catch up, Locke welcomes Lada and some how manages to get the girls to volunteer for the disciplinary commitee. Unfortunately he couldn't stay longer since he was still in his full out furry form and had to get out of sight ASAP.*<br>
<br>
Back in Zix's little pocket dimension, Tamaro was standing about in disbelief, when it occurred to her it might be a good time to get the gently caress your chest hair out of there. Before she could step through her portal though, Zixhaelo zipped over to her and sent her flying through the air. Once Tamaro had painfully crashed back down to the ground, Zixhaelo opened up a portal through Tamaro's chest which was apparently just as arrousing as the forceful kiss the psychpath planted on Tamaro. At first she starts screaming about killing the godess in order to win Tamaro over, but Tamaro tells her to stop and tries to talk to her old friend. This only sends Zixhaelo deeper into her insane breakdown, and before leaving the girl, Zixhaelo declares she will kill Tamaro so they can be together forever.<br>
<br>
The new student, Moon, was having difficulty finding his way about the school considering he wasn't exactly familiar with human establishment. Things could only get better when Alma de Ladron arrived, taking advantage of the wolf by making him witness the death of his pack in a rather traumatizing fashion just so she could feed off his fear. Satisfied with her meal, Alma left Moon, who took a moment to recover. Trying to brush the experience with the ghoul off Moon headed back down the hall only to have yet another strange encounter. Some flying orb approached him, only to turn into a girl the second he touched it. The girl, who calls herself Atlanta, seems just as confused about the existance of yokai and the like as Moon is, so the two decide to accompany eachother for a while. Atlanta even gives Moon a chip necklace that would allow her to appear to him whenever she wanted. The two wander for a while, and after a little bit Moon spots Hotaru and asks her what she was. Needless to say Hotaru instantly burst into tears for no apparent reason.<br>
<br>
Just then the Headmaster comes on the speakers with an announcement; At this time some menace with an explosive fetish was running about the school.<br>
<br>
Cue the sound of various hallways spontaniously combusting around the academy.<br>
<br>
Ashram finally wakes up, only to find Vix standing right by her. Startled as per usual, Ash zips off before Vix can say a word and shuts herself in a closet. Having no reason left to stand about the hallway, Vix decides to go get himself registered as a student.<br>
<br>
Cree, finally overcome by her curiousity of WTF was going on, makes her way to the Headmaster's room, only to find Nevermore covered in silly putty with a cell phone stuck in his eye socket. Considering who was involved, the scene was not all that surprising.<br>
<br>
Keiko, Chizuru and Avin finally make it to Keiko's room! Keiko thanks her new friends and gets into her dorm, though for some reason she still feels somewhat paranoid. While heading back to thier own mess of a dorm, Chizuru mentions she feels the same chill she did when they ran into Lucied the day before. Her suspicion is confirmed as terrified screams are heard from Keiko's room. Chizuru sprinted back to Keiko's room, and nefore Avin could even begin to follow he was restrained and choked by Lucied before being dragged into his shadow. By the time Chizu made it to Keiko's room, the child was already halfway into her shadow, being forced down by a mob of shadowy hands. They drag Keiko down, and once she disappears they begin to reach for Chizuru, but she flees before they can a great movie her. She goes back to tell Avin but realizes he was taken too, and she gets the feeling the kidnappings were Lucied's doing. While wandering about, trying to find something....<b><i>anything</i></b> that could help her save her friends, she meets Shadow, who warns her about Lucied's evil intent, only to find he came too late.<br>
<br>
At about this time Norah Bright was going for a stroll, still fuming about the death of her companion. Just thinking about it angered her so much that she punched a wall, and in concequence nearly punched the head off the girl coming out of a closet. Norah is absolutely bewildered when she realizes the girl she nearly just decapitated looks almost exactly like her deceased companion! She apologises immediately and accompanies the girl down the hall to have a nice chat. Ash seems unusually unafraid of the multi-color haired girl...though her fear return when a bat silly putty crazy half-vampire suddenly appears at thier side. Oddly enough Anarchy - whose blood soaked clothes clearly showed she was significantly homicidal - had no intent of killing either of them; she had seemed to have taken an interest in Norah, since she had never before <span style="text-decoration: line-through">tasted</span> met an observer.<br>
<br>
While conversing with the pair, who eventually figured out Anna was not a threat (at least at the moment) Anna pointed out and questioned Ash's artificial arm, which just so happened to be the same arm Belphegor had sliced off of Noah. Ash tries to recall why she had the robotics, but finds she can't remember. She discovers she can't remember alot actually, and is thusly confused.<br>
<br>
Lucied, now in his own shadow world, approaches Keiko, who is in tearful shambles. He holds Avins by the throat and begins to torture him, leaving Keiko to beg him to show mercy on her friend. Naturally he declines, but instead proposes Keiko assists him.<br>
<br>
And now begins the final stretch, where hell breaks loose at TJA....<br>
<br>
It all started when the demon Akuma arouse from Hell via a collosal crack in the earth. After tormenting a few city folk he began his trek towards Tenshi Jigoku Academy, only to be stopped half way there by the welcoming party, AKA Xirea and a few spider animated corpses. The two exchange conversation, and find they have similar sadistic goals.<br>
<br>
In the meantime the school recieves it's latest werewolf studant as Tobias enters the building. After getting relucant help from the genie Zicron who led him to the main office, Tobias found his way to his room. Although he knew he was supposed to have called Madam Witch by now he blew it off to go exploring. His exploring led him to Yuki, a fire elemental who had collapsed upon arrival. Due to her ability to see one's true form, she immediately recognizes he is a werewolf. She doesn't seem afraid though, just hungry, so he gives her a sanwhich and carries her to her dorm...with turns out to be the same dorm as Tobias.<br>
<br>
<b>AND THEN ELSEWHERE APPLE APPEARS IN AN EXPLOSION OF SWEETS!!!</b><br>
<br>
All the while Locke lay on his bed, keeping up with all that was going on around the school via updates from the students and various surveillance devices he planted around the grounds. Vix hovered into the room, making himself comfy on the bed beside Locke. Then one thing led to another and sure enough the two were making sweet sweet yaoi.<br>
<br>
The silver haired robot maid Bambi stepped out of Avin and Chizuru's room, having completely restored everything.<br>
<br>
Back to Norah and Pals, Amachi showed up to the three girls. Ash cheerfully greets Amachi, though it occurs to her she shouldn't recognize the stranger.<br>
<br>
Outside the school Oz flew in via robot, only to be welcomed by Tamaro falling in from a portal and landing on his head.<br>
<br>
Xirea decides it's about time for Akuma and him to stir up some "fun" in the halls of Tenshi Jigoku Academy, and thusly he sends hoards of his spider army flooding the school. He then stabs himself in the chest releasing the thousands of spider eggs within him spewing out onto the floor before collapsing and destroying his body, only to be born anew in a form more suited for a spider king. His arachnid forces invade the school at once, spreading nightmares and capturing various students in thier webs. Akuma joins in, summoning his own demonic minions to wreak havoc. Before setting out to find a worthy opponent to fight, he takes one minion and devours it's soul and form.<br>
<br>
Having heard the rampaging spiders outside thier dorm allong with the screams of thier victims, Tobias hurries to wake up Yuki, who awakes with a start and mistakingly punches the werewolf in the gut. After apologizing she insists they go help save those in harms way, not seeming to care that the enemy is incredibly powerful or that she's only in her underwear. Tobias follows, uneasy about rushing into battle, even if the insanity in his head tells him to "HuNt AnD KiLl!!". While the two scower the halls, Xirea, having gotten tired of waiting for the fun to come to him, traps Tobias and Yuki by caging in the two with his monsterous spiderlegs bursting out at them from the floor. By some miracle Yuki manages to get the two out, but only to find herself in the arms of the spider king, immobilized. He carries her off to the gymnasium and sits with her on his throne of skeletons. Yuki is unwilling, but still cannot move. Soon after taking a seat, the observers Abigor and Belphegor burst into the gym. The spider king welcomes them to stay and watch the show, and with nothing better to do the pair complies.<br>
<br>
Before setting off to save Yuki, Tobias went over to check on a nearby "human", who seemed to have been attacked. However the strange bespectacled human healed remarkably fast. The human, who claimed his name was Alfred, got to his feet, brushed himself off and accused Tobias of being one of the monsters responsible for the current havoc about the school. He made the same accusation to Moon as the silver approached them, though both Tobias and Moon assured Alfred that they were instead looking to put an end to the destruction. The three decided to team up, and quickly headed for the gymnasium, Tobias taking the lead. Despite having run into quite a few traps laid out by Xirea, Tobias made it to the spider king's lair unscathed thanks to Romano, who unknowingly to the werewolf had tagged along. Deciding to let the madness take it's toll, Tobias made his first move at Xirea by chucking Romano at him. Romano takes this surprisingly well, defying the laws of physics before landing a kick at Xirea's head and retrieving Yuki. He started to heal the girl while Tobias prepared to attack Xirea, only to be stopped by Akuma who challeged him to a battle. To make things interesting, Akuma took Yuki and locked her up in a shadowy cage hanging from the cieling. Evidently, this fight is not nearly entertaining enough for Xirea, and in an attempt to spice things up the arachnomancer switched Yuki and Tobias so that the battle would instead be demon versus elemental. Akuma did not seem as pleased with his new opponent, but reluctantly began the fight against her anyways. As it turns out, both Yuki and Akuma enjoy the fight, and because of this Akuma backs off, no longer wishing the girl any serious harm. Yuki suggested the demon register as a student, in which Akuma hesitantly agrees.<br>
<br>
Naturally this friendly exchange disgusted the spider king, who in response ordered his spider frenzy to attack them, breaking the shadow cage that held Tobias. Akuma, Tobias and Yuki began to fight off the swarm together as Xirea prepared to finish them off.<br>
<br>
While hovering over the battle going down at the gym, Belphegor was irritated to find Alma had appeared out of no where and had taken a seat on Belph's head, poking the observer's busty chest for silly puttys and giggles. This didn't last long though, for as much as Abigor tried to restrain her other half Belphegor quickly decapitated Alma with a lightning sword. In just another moment several Almas appeared. This actually amused Belphegor, and she and Alma got along unusually well, though Abigor did not approve of the violence.<br>
<br>
Below, Xirea began his attack by going for the demon once allied with him. After leaving Akuma in enough pain that the demon actually melted away, he lunged at Tobias, pinning the werewolf to the ground. While Yuki used her power to recreate Akuma's body, Moon teleports himself and Alfred into the battlefront, and almost instantly Alfred charges into battle. Then Anarchy bursts in, soaked in spider guts after having erradicated the entirety of Xirea's spider army. She wishes to lesve no survivors from her arachnid genocide, and in a homicidal beserk fury she began to slaughter the remaining spider creatures. Alfred manages to get Xirea at his mercy, and just as Xirea believes he is about to get off with an average formal punishment the slayer lops off his head, ending the reign of terror brought on by the fallen spider king. Nothing more is left but the few signs of destruction here and there, a mass of arachnid corpses and the spider king's body itself, from which a bone was carved out and used as Moon's chew toy.<br>
<br>
AND SO CONCLUDES DAY TWO.</font></div>

Race: Librarian -- A race birthed by the joining of demons and spirits, this race focuses more on simple...knowing. They are capable of summoning lesser and greater demons and spirits due to their connection to them, though they are very docile people for the most part. Telekenesis is a common power within the race, along with a strange...frenzy that can occur within the beings. When under a great deal of stress, they can enter a frenzy known as a 'Lunatic High,' in which they become amazingly aggressive, their strength is doubled, and their pain recipants simply...deactivate, making them immune to pain. Bloodless can still kill them, however. They are NOT very durabable in hand-to-hand combat, and as such rely on their summons to fight for them.<br>
<br>
(I hope I did this right..../orz]<br>
<br>
Personality:<br>
Kyouki is an...interesting girl, to say. She can come off as cold when one first meets her, due to her not being the most friendly person. She tends to space out alot, which can lead to one thinking she's ignoring them. Despite these negative traits, she truly is a caring girl. Once you become her friend, she treats you like family, always making sure you have what you need. She's not the best leader, but she is one to rely on when it comes to orders, and does her best to make sure that whatever needs doing gets done. Kyou adores children to the point of becoming their surrogate mother if needed, and her entire demeanor changes when around them, going from cold to shining. Her goal in life is to try and make everyone happy, even if it means sacrificing her own happiness in the process.<br>
<br>
As far as it comes to her working, she has not much of a regard for her own health, and will take on everyone's work if someone doesn't stop her. She's prone to passing out every now and then from lack of sleep trying to finish all of the work she takes upon herself. But even with that, don't EVER think she'll complain, because she is incapable of doing so. This mindset usually gets her 'grounded' from doing too much.<br>
<br>
With relationships, Kyouki just...doesn't attempt to understand the concept of romance. She never really paid attention to it, because nobody ever really...tried to pursue her. Besides, to her, it gets in the way of her work. To try and break her out of this mindset would take quite some dedication. She doesn't exactly understand the concept of personal space much, and enjoys hugging people ALOT, should she get used to you.<br>
<br>
She has an extreme issue regarding people's hands anywhere near the back of her neck. There is an issue regarding it to where pressing down on a certain spot makes her really....bothered. If a person DOES manage to pull this off, she immediately freaks out, bulldozing down anything in her way to escape the scene and dunk her head in cold water or something in order to fix the issue.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
History:<br>
When she was alive, Kyouki had a...broken type of life, considering her family chose to try and blend in with the mortal realm. She usually spent her time working while her mother and her father screamed at each other. They were always at odds over money issues, so she got a job at the age of fifteen, assisting with cooking in a traditional chinese resturant. She never got to hang out with any friends, much less make permanent ones, due to the drama at her house. She herself was victimized by her parents, usually showing up to school hiding bandaged arms and other injuries from her teachers. But she never complained. To her, it was simply a normal thing. Something that families went through. It was when she was nineteen, that everything went wrong.<br>
<br>
Kyouki was walking to her home from her job, now the head chef of a gourmet resturant, and decided she would visit her parents. When she opened the door, she found her mother on the floor, dead. A bullet hole was in her head. Kyouki thought she was crazy, trying to wake her mother up, until she heard a gunshot upstairs. Suffering from denial, she walked up to her parents' room to find her father on the bed, bleeding out. A gun was in his hand. <br>
Kyouki screamed.<br>
<br>
She couldn't take it. She couldn't think straight. She took the gun, grabbed a box of matches, and went out side the house. She set it on fire, then brought the gun to her head...<br>
But it didn't work.<br>
She would later wake up within the Academy walls, and meet the school's librarian, who ironically enough, was a Librarian himself. Quite a position to fit his race. As it would turn out, he was a friend of her family's, and took her in, raising her. Since then she has lived within the school, listening to her new 'Father' and doing her best to make sure everyone is happy.<br>
