<b>Carbon-based.</b> Of the types of life capable of existing 95% of it was Carbon based. Humans, Felines and the like all fall into this category. Anything that we would consider biological is a carbon based life-form.<br>
<b>Silicon-based.</b> Despite the protestations of the carbon-based life forms they aren’t the only type of being to exist. The Silicon-based are sentient stone to a ‘fleshy’ perspective. The band of worlds they can exist upon is wider and more easily accommodated for the silicon based life than it is for carbon-based. But the silicon based life finds it much harder to develop and advance. Silicon life, being functionally immortal, doesn’t consider things in years or decades but centuries and millennia. However they are slow to act and react unless in imminent, and crystal clear, danger.<br>
<b>Gaseous</b>. How they exist is beyond anybodies comprehension, except themselves of course, this type of species are typically seen as either diaphanous clouds winging across the galaxy or as similar clouds upon Gas Giants. However this form of life has never displayed any real intelligence or technological capacity and is literally referred to as “space-cattle” by most species.<br>
<b>Energy</b>. At first glance can often be mistaken for Gaseous life but such an assumption is a major, and deadly, mistake. If a Gaseous type is space-cattle the Energy beings are definitely the deadly predators. More intelligent. More deadly and definitely capable of advancement and development and even technological advancement. It should be noted that Silicon-based lifeforms are extremely vulnerable to “possession” from these creatures.<br>
<br>
GM NOTE: Neither Gaseous nor Energy beings are playable. Each “species” has sub-categories to choose from with benefits and disadvantages to match.</div>

<br>
<b>Energy Weapons</b>: Lasers, Particle Beams, Plasma Cannons (EMF Jacketed Plasma “packets”) Pulse Lasers etc. (You can be a little creative.)<br>
<b>Hypervelocity Kinetic Kill Weapons</b>: “There is no kill like kinetic kill” Now these are not relativistic kinetic weapons, these are fired under 14% the speed of light and are slugthrowers, railguns, gauss-guns etc. <br>
<b>Missiles/Torpedoes</b>: Also known more accurately as “Combat Drones” these missiles or torpedoes are high-velocity craft with a crude engine and maneuvering thrusters. Their payloads can be explosive, electromagnetic, energy or any number of variants. Missiles have a number of Warhead Types. When a ship has missiles designate the number of Launchers. Missiles/Torpedoes per launcher, Missile Chassis and the Warhead type. (EG: 6-12-LM-N = 6 Launchers, 12 Missiles per launcher, Light Missile and Nuclear.) (Missile List is on a scale of destructiveness. Nuclear and Anionic missiles are Civilian Issue.)<br>
<i>Warhead List.:</i><br>
Nuclear. (N)<br>
Anionic (A)<br>
Neutronium (Ne)<br>
Hercular (H)<br>
Merculite (M)<br>
H.E. X-ray (HEX)<br>
Ion Pulsar (IP)<br>
Antimatter: (AM) (RESTRICTED: Hyper-Advanced Technology Trait)<br>
Energy Pulsar (EP) (RESTRICTED: Hyper-Advanced Technology Trait)<br>
Omega (O) (RESTRICTED: Hyper-Advanced Technology Trait + Energy Pulsar Trait + Antimatter Trait + Enerjax Trait.)<br>
<i>Chassis List:</i><br>
Point Defence (PD)<br>
Rocket (Rk)<br>
Light Missile (LM)<br>
Medium Missile (MM)<br>
Large Missile (LRGM)<br>
Orbit to Surface Missile (OTS)<br>
Torpedo (T)<br>
<b>Armour:</b> Simple armoured plating. Armour Plating is decided by a mix of factors. Armour should be rated according to this scale. After the dash the thickness of the armour goes. This is measured in centimeters. (From Weakest to Strongest.) (Example: Z-12 is Zortrium Armour, 12 centimetres thick.) Titanium and Tritanium are civilian grade armour normally.<br>
Titanium. (T1-)<br>
Tritanium (T2-)<br>
Zortrium (Z-)<br>
Duranium (D-)<br>
Neutronium (N-) (RESTRICTED Hyper-Advanced Technology Trait.)<br>
Adamantium (A-) (RESTRICTED Hyper-Advanced Technology Trait + Neutronium Armour Trait.)<br>
<b>Shields</b>: Shields are various types of energy field to protect a vessel from damage and thus, destruction. There are several types of Shield. Shields are denoted by class then rating the rating is in Roman Numerals, type ten is the best. (EG: P-X = A Type ten Particle Shield.)<br>
Particle Shields. (P) Protects against particle weapons.<br>
Energy Shields. (E) Protects against energy weapons.<br>
Dampening Shields (D) Reduces the damaging effects of a weapon.<br>
Distort Shields (DS) Reduces chances of being hit.<br>
Displacer Shields. (DPS) (RESTRICTED Hyper-Advanced Technology Trait + Distort Shields Trait + Dampening Shields Trait.) Completely teleports the ship 50 metres from a significant threat. No use against blast weapons. Only works 70% of the time.<br>
<b>Engines:</b> There are a number of different classes of engines. Engines are marked in the same method as Shields. The Engine Class and rating. (NOTE: Nuclear is a Civilian class engine.)<br>
Nuclear. (N)<br>
Fusion. (F)<br>
Plasma. (P)<br>
Enerjax (EJ) (RESTRICTED: Hyper-Advanced Technology Trait.)<br>
Antimatter (AM) (RESTRICTED: Hyper-Advanced Technology Trait.)<br>
Reactors: Power Systems for ships and planets alike. For ships Rating is done identically to Engines and Shields. (NOTE: Nuclear is a Civilian class reactor.)<br>
Nuclear. (N)<br>
Fusion. (F)<br>
Plasma. (P)<br>
Energjax: (EJ) (RESTRICTED: Hyper-Advanced Technology Trait.)<br>
Antimatter: (AM) (RESTRICTED: Hyper-Advanced Technology Trait.)<br>
Omega: (O) (RESTRICTED: Hyper-Advanced Technology Trait. Antimatter Trait + Enerjax Trait.)<br>
<b>Artificial Gravity:</b> Artificial Gravity is a common technology to most species. <br>
<b>Sensors</b>: Sensors are required to find and see things in space and on a planet. They are marked again by class and rating.<br>
Optical. (O)<br>
Thermal (T) <br>
Radiation (R)<br>
Electromagnetic (EM)<br>
Gravitational (G) (RESTRICTED: Hyper-Advanced Technology Trait)<br>
High-Power (HP) (RESTRICTED: Hyper-Advanced Technology Trait)<br>
<b>Nanotechnology</b>: Nanotechnology has advanced in many nations and or cultures and its used to produce better processors and assist in construction.<br>
<b>Biotechnology</b>: Biotechnology is the same sort of thing as Nanotechnology but biological and designed for biological constructs.<br>
<b>Cybernetics</b>: Fusing flesh with machine.</div>

			<b><font size="4">Nation Creation.</font></b><br>
<br>
<b><font size="3">Species and Empire Size.</font></b><br>
<br>
<b>Species Type:</b> First the player must select the category of the species that their people represent.<br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px; ">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:2px">Quote:</div>
	<table cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%">
	<tbody><tr>
		<td class="alt2" style="border:1px inset">
			
				Each “species” will have in the bottom of their descriptions an italicized notation of their inherent advantage and disadvantages. Each will have a “trait” these traits will be species unique and cannot be taken by any other species (and are not in the traits section to reflect this.).<br>
<br>
"Humanoid": A generally primate-like species development. Will usually be quite similar in physiology and psychology to other Humanoid Species. There is no inherent advantage or disadvantage with Humanoids.<br>
<br>
"Dogs": Canine-like species generally fall into this category. The The Canine have strong senses of discipline and 'pack-work' communication. Though are almost always smaller in stature. The Canine often have a stricter sense of honour than others.<br>
Canine: Advantage:<br>
Endurance. The Canine will pursue something far longer than anyone else might expect and when they catch it (so to speak) they don’t let go.<br>
Canine: Disadvantage:<br>
Singleminded. The Canine often pursue something to the exclusion of all else. This can leave them totally unaware of developing political situations and things they should know but are too busy to notice.<br>
<br>
“Ursine”: 'Ursine (Bears)' are generally larger and more warlike than the 'Canine' species though both are otherwise similar.<br>
Ursine: Advantage: <br>
Intimidating. While others can duplicate an intimidating appearance or power with their abilities the Ursine are naturally intimidating. This gives them some advantage when in negotiation with “lesser” species.<br>
Ursine: Disadvantage:<br>
Prone to Anger: Despite any attempts to curb it the Ursine are for lack of a better word. Vicious. Though not in the intelligent and calculating instances other species are the Ursines anger is uncontrolled and increases their chances of errors, mistakes and severe breaches in judgement.<br>
<br>
"Feline": The "cats" of the universe, however they are much closer to "cats" than they are to "cat-girls". Prone to larger tracts of open land, and a "hunter" behaviour. <br>
Feline: Advantage: <br>
Ambush Predators. Ambush and taking the enemy by surprise is very much ingrained in feline genetics. While they lack the “long distance” view of the Canines they rarely need to securing what they need and want with much more speed than one might expect.<br>
Feline: Disadvantage: <br>
Independent: The Felines are very much dependent on a loose hierarchy and clan structure. They will be at odds with one another as often as not and find a co-operative spirit very hard to achieve. <br>
<br>
"Vermin": The Vermin are just that, species another would consider verminous, Rats, Mice etc and Similar. A Vermin species however can be considerably powerful. They have incredible reproductive rates, extreme intellect and are generally extremely vicious.<br>
Vermin: Advantage: <br>
Super-Breeders: The Vermin expand at an incredible rate, a single litter of babies can easily be six to ten or more vermin!<br>
Vermin: Advantage: <br>
Intellectual: Despite their fractitious and cannibalistic natures the Vermin are incredible intelligent and their sciences are undoubtedly advanced if unstable and dangerous. (NOTE: Vermin Automatically Start with the Antimatter Hypertechnology and are required to use it in all major technology. They cannot buy OMEGA under any circumstances.)<br>
Vermin: Disadvantage: <br>
Infighting: Killing, backstabbing and jostling for position are critical to the Vermin. Both as a measure of Status and as a method of population control. <br>
Vermin: Disadvantage: <br>
Environmental Hazard: An uncontrolled infestation of Vermin can be bad for Crops. The more Sentient Vermin are bad for planets. Due to shorter life spans and a generally genetic pre-disposition to greed the Vermin instinctually do the equivalent of strip-mining worlds. The idea of farming and the like for later are entirely alien to them. ALL vermin worlds are heavily polluted, corrupted and strip-mined. Beautiful is a word that cannot be applied to a Vermin held planet.<br>
<br>
"Hive": The Insects of the Universe. Unfortunately very very dangerous insects. The "hive" types often react poorly to any other species, including other hives, IF they can get past that hurdle they are often excellent source of labour and cheaper materials. But its a big IF. Usually communicates through scent or visual patterns on the carapace.<br>
Hive: Advantage:<br>
United. In mind body and soul a hive species is totally “as one” what one knows the others know very soon. This means they’re also impossible to infiltrate.<br>
Hive: Advantage: <br>
Without Number, the long and short? Hives have massive populations far in excess of most others by an order of magnitude or more. The smallest hive nation almost has a larger population than the largest of the other species. But they live short lives and are replaced by the thousand.<br>
Hive: Disadvantage:<br>
Dense: There are few “thinkers” in a Hive Species. Most of them have some form of Domination over the others, and many of the highest have developed technological or psychic control over their species. However that leaves their multi-tasking abilities at constant overdrive. As such they may do many many things well but they do nothing great let alone brilliantly. In short, don’t expect trickery, subtlety or devious activities from them as they’re far too busy to waste mental capacity on it.<br>
Hive: Disadvantage:<br>
Geologically Unstable. Hive Worlds are unstable due to the many thousands to millions of kilometres of unstable ground and tunnels. Orbital Bombardment against Hive worlds is three times as effective as normal worlds. Moreover the only “fortifications” available to a hive are shields.<br>
<br>
"Flights": Anything bird/bat/winged-thing-like. These are the once "flighted" creatures, some still can fly. There are three subcategories. "Peaceful" The "seagulls, pidgeons etc" of space, peaceful, often greedy. Massively mercantile. The "Hawks" are hunters, predators and very vicious and war-like. Then there are the "Bats" a category of sneaky underhanded but very polite political animals. <br>
Flights: Advantage:<br>
Three Dimensional. Unlike other species the Flights have always been able to view the universe from a three dimensional perspective. This makes them highly capable in space compared to others. In fact all the best Captains and Admirals in space are Flights.<br>
Flights: Disadvantage:<br>
Fragile. Flights are easily… Broken… while their strategies may be better they cannot handle the same high gee manuevering as another species due to their delicate bone structure. This despite their tactical advantages leaves them at a disadvantage against high-speed and agile enemies.<br>
<br>
"Bulls": Herbivores of the universe that evolved to sentience. They can either be the passive, peaceful people sort or the raging bull sort. The former can often become the latter if pushed too far. They however usually have a poor agriculture industries or actual industries due to the amount they consume. Always have a high population base however.<br>
Bulls: Advantage:<br>
Thunderous Momentum. When the Bulls set their minds on something it gets done. And usually broken. If you can’t break the Bulls early into something you find they start to steamroll. For example. If they begin developing an industry (doesn’t matter what) you often find they’ve steamrolled it into a major concern.<br>
Bulls: Disadvantage:<br>
Stupid. The fact is, despite their determination and momentum building they make very poor scientists. They develop less than one tenth the number of scientists another nation might. As such Bulls may only ever have one science world for every ten worlds they possess.<br>
<br>
"Scales": Fish evolved to technologists. There are many issues with the Scales that aren't resolved. Most are predatory in some fashion or another. As the saying goes. There are no Herbivores in the sea. However they REQUIRE worlds rich in water and life and literally are unable to settle anything else. That they achieved spaceflight OR sentience is a miracle that confuses many. How the hell do you forge metals without fire?<br>
Scales: Advantage: <br>
Surprising Developments. The Scales are excellent at what they do. If anyone could figure out how. They have a large number of development facilities. Scales get 1 Free Hypertechnology advance on top of normal.<br>
Scales: Disadvantage:<br>
Ocean Dependencies. The Scales REQUIRE water. A Lot of Water. Planetary amounts of water. As such there are very few worlds to support Scale life adequately. As such their worlds are often more spread out and harder to defend than normal. It also means they can only stage colonisation efforts at 1/5th the speed of other species.<br>
<br>
"Serps": Lizards and Serpents. ALWAYS Highly Aggressive and powerful, but low in population and incapable of taking low temperature worlds or worlds without much moisture. While capable of using standard M class terra-compatible worlds they would be happy if you found a Swamp world. Population kept in check by typically eating young.<br>
Serps: Advantage<br>
Territorial/Rad Resistance. The Serps have a combined trait. Due to their unique natures they prefer close tight territories. As such more than once they have irradiated a planet on purpose to melt the ice-caps enough to increase the thickness of the atmosphere and become a “cook-house” perfectly suited to them.<br>
Serps: Disadvantage<br>
Cannabalistic. The Serps despite a high birth rate keep their population under control, and small, relatively, due to the fact that the strong kill, and eat, the weak. While they feed on other foods normally the old and infirm are killed and eaten by their family as are hatchlings or children judged too weak to survive.<br>
<br>
Totally Alien: Totally Alien Species do not fit any of the types outlined here. They are either so rare or just so beyond understanding that they can’t be categorised as above.<br>
Totally Alien: Advantage<br>
The Player may create an Advantage suited to their species. Bear in mind that the acceptance or declining of the chosen advantage is entirely subject to the GM.<br>
Totally Alien: Disadvantage<br>
The Player may create a disadvantage to counter the “power” the Advantage Brings.<br>
Totally Alien: Disadvantage<br>
Diplomatic Bunglers: <br>
<br>
“Crystalline”: The Crystalline species are a self-replicating matrice of crystal that develops an energy interaction within its binding crystals. These species are rare, slow and timeless. HOWEVER they have an innate understanding of energy and its applications even though this leaves them vulnerable to exploitation by the star-faring energy predators. (GM NOTE: Crystalline are not recommended for anyone with the slightest doubt as to their ability to carry it.)<br>
Crystalline: Advantage:<br>
Energy Matrice. Energy-based weaponry built by the Crystalline Species is more powerful than those built by other species. And it is not uncommon for the being to be the projector.<br>
Crystalline: Advantage: <br>
Ageless. The Crystalline are immortal and will live forever providing their crystals remain undamaged. As such they have a wealth of experience and the benefits of long-term planning.<br>
Crystalline: Disadvantage:<br>
Non-Reproductive. As far as most species are concerned the Crystalline do not reproduce. The fact is that it is true. As a mortal race sees it the Crystalline don’t reproduce. The fact is that it can take hundreds of thousands to millions of years to give birth to one. Giving birth to 1000 in a century is considered to be a risk of overpopulation!<br>
Crystalline: Disadvantage:<br>
Non-Militaristic. The Crystalline do not understand militaries, wars or the like. They cannot, in their natural forms, wage wars or keep a normal military. In an hostile environment the and due to their fragile nature the Crystalline are ENTIRELY dependent on machine armies and artificial intelligences to wage their wars for them. Losing a couple thousand Crystalline is considered a disaster of massive proportions.

</div><b>POPULATION </b><br>
<br>
There are three “levels” available to choose from for each species. 1st is a “small” nation. 2nd is a “medium” nation and 3rd is a “large” nation. Now the system has. Each scale has an advantage and disadvantage.<br>
Small Nation:<br>
A small nation has 50 Points to spend on planets and systems.<br>
Advantage: <br>
A small nation has a tighter structure and strength, its administration issues go through more smoothly and has less red tape (unless you take the penalty that changes this) more importantly they are harder to infiltrate with spies and more skilled at defending their own territories. <br>
Disadvantage: <br>
The more compact nature of a Small Nation can work against it in time of war. While they are skilled at defending their territories against loss they cannot afford to actually lose much. As such they are more susceptible to political threat.<br>
Medium Nation: <br>
A Medium nation has 100 Points to spend on planets and systems.<br>
Advantage:<br>
Balanced, a medium nation is militaristically, politically and economically stable compared to a smaller or larger nation. As such their science has benefited. (A Medium Nation can choose one more Hypertechnology than normal OR has two more traits it can spend in any category.)<br>
Disadvantage: <br>
Out there. A medium nation cannot “hide” it is a public entity and will be discovered by anyone willing to look. More importantly they aren’t “unimportant” they are less easy to push around politically or militarily but they are more likely targets of such pushing around.<br>
Large Nation:<br>
A Large nation has 200 points to spend on planets and systems.<br>
Advantage: <br>
Powerhouse, a Large Nation has a LOT of might to throw around industrially and militarily. Their massive size creates its own issues but manpower and industrial capacity are not one of them. <br>
Disadvantage:<br>
A Large Nation has a large bureaucracy to go with it and this creates a large amount of red tape and pressure. A large nation cannot expand as quickly as a smaller might during times of peace and colonisation is right out until population pressures force it.<br>
Each Nations Population is represented in points. Each point represents roughly so many individuals. This is a breakdown of the rough numbers of people per point.<br>
Humanoid: 1 Billion<br>
Dogs: 750 Million<br>
Ursine:  500 Million<br>
Feline:  800 Million<br>
Vermin: 10 Billion<br>
Hive:  100 Billion<br>
Flights:  400 Million<br>
Bulls:  600 Million<br>
Scales:  800 Million<br>
Serps:  500 Million<br>
Totally Alien: *Up to the Player*<br>
Crystalline: 10 Million<br>
<br>
<b>PLANETS AND SYSTEMS:</b><br>
<br>
<b>Planets and Systems.</b><br>
Each nation has a number of systems and planets. In the old system each type of planet had a specific effect. And this is replicated in this as well. However now Systems are included. Industry is no longer relegated to a planet but is an effect provided by a whole Solar Systems output in resources and valuable materials. As such Systems are almost, if not more important than planets. A person might have a single system and fifty planets (unlikely... I hope...) yet be completely outgunned by someone with three systems and one planet! (Also unlikely)<br>
<br>
<b>Systems:</b><br>
Systems is designed to specify how “rich” a system is in resources, it has no effect on the number of planets within it, but a resource rich system is more likely to have something like a Gas Hypergiant than a ‘barren’ system.<br>
Barren System:<br>
5 Points.<br>
A Barren System is resource poor in the extreme. But also less likely to be fought over by others. <br>
Average System:<br>
10 Points<br>
An Average system is just that, average, most systems are like this.<br>
Rich System:<br>
15 Points<br>
A Rich system is packed with valuable asteroids and gas giants.<br>
High-Value System:<br>
20 Points<br>
A High-Value System is the best that can be found. A nation may only have a maximum of 2.<br>
<br>
<b>Planets: </b><br>
A planet is where the majority of your species/nation probably lives.<br>
Agri-Worlds: You MUST have one for every three other planets. (If you have 4 planets or less one must be an Agri-world. If you have between 5-8 planets two must be Agri-worlds etc)<br>
2 Points<br>
VERMIN: Must have one for every TWO other planets. (If you have 3 planets or less one must be an Agri-world. If you have between 4-6 planets two must be Agri-worlds etc)<br>
Pleasure World Poor: A world designed for pleasing your people.<br>
3 Points.<br>
Pleasure World Good: A world designed for pleasing your people.<br>
6 Points<br>
Capital World: All Races must have one.<br>
10 Points.<br>
Research World: Centres of Research<br>
4 Points<br>
Hunting Preserve/Training Planet:  <br>
5 Points<br>
Population Worlds: A world Dedicated to housing people for your Armies and minor industries. <br>
3 Points<br>
Mining World: <br>
4 Points

			<b><font size="4">TRAIT SYSTEM:</font></b><br>
Ok, for now, the system is reverting back to the points based system. The trait system also no longer has any “real” effect. <br>
Each Nation gets ONE trait from every Category. (One National, One Technical, One Population, One Military, One Hyper-Technology)<br>
After a nation has spent those points they get TWELVE! to spend in any categories! ANY!<br>
<br>
TRAITS CANNOT STACK!<br>
<br>
National Traits: <br>
GETTING HUGE!: Your nation has a serious skyscraper, monument and battleship fetish and likes to build big. BIG. BIG.<br>
The Mossad: What you know, I know.<br>
Komitet Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti: We have not managed to gather any information on this trait. (KGB)<br>
Implausibly Efficient Government: Your bureaucrats cut through red tape with machetes.<br>
Fair Dinkum: Your state has a rep as a straight shooter (metaphorically) and an honest dealer (literally).<br>
The only Party in town: The government controls everything. Including you. Especially you.<br>
Free Market Boomtown: The nice thing about a corporate state is there's profits for everyone. The not so nice thing is that you have to go back to your cubicle now. <br>
Industrial Heartland: Tank factories stretch to the horizon and shipyards fill the night sky with waste light. (Each Industrial Worlds capacity goes up by 25%.<br>
New Hollywood: A cultural centre of the galaxy. Everyone who's anyone has made their fame here.<br>
Who Cares About Uzbekistan: Your polity is simply not on the galactic radar and thus avoids a lot of the Bad Shit that can go down. . . (Can only be taken by Lvl1 Population Nations.)<br>
Party Please: Your diplomats are just so good-natured or know so many skeleton-filled closets that they can get into strategically useful alliances much easier than others. Of course, then you need to live up to what you signed . . .<br>
Cargo Cultist: If freighters were warships, you'd blot out the stars with your fleet. You still do, but there's less gunfire involved.<br>
Load-Bearing State: You remember all those times you beat up a boss and suddenly the castle collapsed? Well, you're kind of like that to the galactic economy.<br>
<br>
Population Traits:<br>
Loyalty: A populace that through some reason or another is loyal to its government, through fear or "cookie day" it doesn't matter, these people are loyal.<br>
Man-Machine Interface: Thought the looking glass of circuitry and neurons into the uncharted territories of bioelectronic convergence.<br>
Newtypes: The next stage in human evolution; the peak of human mental performance and acuity. (Larger Psionics Population)<br>
SPACE MARINES!: Your people are physically superior specimens, with buff bodies and quick hands.<br>
Cyberize!: Physical cybernetic modifications are rampant in your population. Not limited by mere biology like SPACE MARINES! but likewise not inherent just by being born. Sucks to be a copper.<br>
Heroic Age: Your people see themselves as Spartan Heroes, not Persian Generals. Shame the Spartans made poor civilians . . .<br>
Flag-Wavers: It doesn't matter what you do, you'll always win the elections. You must choose something particularly dear to your population that they wave flags about.<br>
Eureka!: The desire to take things apart and figure out how they work runs deep in your people's blood.<br>
Hard Workers: Your people really roll up their sleeves and work. (Each Industrial Worlds capacity goes up by 25% is cumulative with Industrial Heartland)<br>
Stupidly Brave: Nobody would think of calling your people cowards.<br>
Not One Step Back!: You hold your ground no matter what, militarily OR politically.<br>
Tough as a Coffin Nail: Your people are just ridiculously tough and can survive true environmental extremes. Requires SPACE MARINES!, Cyberize<br>
<br>
Military Traits: (Benefits under the military section.)<br>
High Speed, Low Drag: Hit and Run. Really quickly.<br>
Tortoise and the Hare: Slow, steady and durable wins the race.<br>
Network-Paradigm Processor: Communism in warfare? Unheard of!<br>
Battleships!: You've got a lot more battleships than most people. Also comes in other variants. (You could take is "Carriers!" or "Destroyers!" or "Super-Capitals!" potentially)<br>
Armament De-Regulation: Who puts 16" guns on freighters? You do!<br>
Army General Staff: Your focus is mostly on taking and holding ground with troops, be that planets, space stations or hostile warships.<br>
Awesome Training: This trait is only worth one, but costs two because people are munchkins.<br>
Death Spiraller: Why buy ten fighters when you can buy one five times as good?<br>
Knife in the Back: You prefer the silence of a SPF strike to the brutishness of a battle line bombardment.<br>
Ninja Space pirate: Arr matey! You'll never escape our pirate U-Boats!<br>
Dispersed Operations: All spaceships can go quite a while without resupply and operate without fleets. Yours are optimized for this.<br>
Space Trenches: If it was possible to dig holes in space-time to provide cover for your battleships, you'd do so.<br>
A Penny Saved: Just because a cruiser is two generations behind the state of the art doesn't mean its useless!<br>
Main Guns!: The age of the battleship is back with a vengeance, this time with spinally-mounted cannons for all.<br>
<br>
Technical Traits: <br>
Mechanical Monstrosities: Who needs fighters when you can have giant robots!<br>
Biowanker: Instead of heavy metal, your engineers have gone down the path of biotechnology.<br>
Nanowanker: You have access to economically useful amounts of nanotechnology.<br>
On The Run!: Most people don't strap engines to factories and cram them into carriers. Most people.<br>
Stealth Obsessed: Most people engineer a bit of stealth cladding into their warships. You use it for internal decking.<br>
Flash: Your stuff just has that extra polish that makes it look cooler than everyone else's inferior-looking, blockily-functional equipment.<br>
Plug'n'Play: Modularity is a virtue, so your engineers claim.<br>
Ghost in the Machine: People are a hindrance, so you use machinery as much as possible.<br>
Nazi Superscience: A role for every machine and a machine for every role.<br>
Better Than Your {Keyword}: Don't apply this too broadly or I'll smack you, otherwise it's exactly what it implies.<br>
Hangerize!: Fighters and Mecha are cool (or just an overly important part of your doctrines) so you stick them in everything you can. This provides strike/superiority ability in addition to the usual utility-craft hangars.<br>
<br>
Historical Traits: (MUST take ONE ONLY) No planets provide this. Every nation MUST take one.<br>
Warlike: Your History is filled with bloodshed, violence and the genocide of millions, at your own hands or against you. The point is you won’t back down if you don’t have to.<br>
Diplomatic: You have more skill with diplomacy than most species and consider war to be a final option after all others have been exhausted. Fortunately you’ve kept your records better than others and suffer no diplomatic penalties with different species.<br>
Commercial: A long history of commercial profit and trade fills your peoples lessons as children. Your people don’t learn how Aravais defeated the Chonomeri in a great battle but how Elan robbed Geddas of every last coin in exchange for a drink of water in the desert to survive.<br>
Exodites: You people have been persecuted and hated and they have adapted and learnt to move quickly in short spans of time. If you were to ever evacuate a world it would take a tenth the time of a non-exodite.<br>
In Armour Clad: Your people value defence, shields and armour above diplomacy, strategic weapons and other minor concerns. After all what good are their weapons if they cannot harm you?<br>
<br>
Hyper-technology: <br>
Gravity-Wave Weapons: With a wave of compressed space, one can penetrate standard shielding. Size, complexity and cost ensures that these weapons are rarely seen .<br>
Reaper Drive: A modified and downscaled wormhole drive, Reaper drives allow the equipped vehicle to make a linear “Spacetime Reap” between two points by folding space between the start and end points.<br>
PSI Lens: With better understanding of psionic abilities it eventually became possible to construct amplifiers for said abilities. These allowed mental abilities to be massively upscaled.<br>
Cloaking Devices: Varying degrees of stealth are commonly built into most warships, but true cloaking devices are much less common. Fairly delicate and temperamental they need to be properly integrated into whatever is meant to be cloaked, adding to cost significantly.<br>
Advanced Biotechnology: Some polities have taken the sciences of life to its endpoints and gained the ability to breed living structures and starships. While not as efficient as more conventional ships they do have their advantages.<br>
Antimatter: Relatively easy to produce Anti-matter is usually extremely unstable and hard to store and use, as such they are utterly forbidden to anyone without Advanced A-matter tech. This allows it to be manufactured, stored and used relatively safely. Just hope someone doesn’t shoot containment.<br>
Relativistic Weapons: Projectile weaponry fired past 15% of lightspeed. Incredible levels of damage and destruction are capable.<br>
Field Control: The Manipulation of energy fields to achieve unique and hard to replicate results. (Disruption Fields, gravity fluxes, personal "gravity chutes" etc)<br>
Energy Pulsar: A pulse of energy so massive most fail to understand it.<br>
Omega: Omega is the “ultimate” explosive. A fragment of creation itself detonated in a micro-simulation of the very beginning of the universe. (MUST HAVE ANTIMATTER AND ENERJAX!)<br>
Neutronium: An excellent armour. Neutronium is alloyed against all known science into one of the densest materials in the universe making an excellent armour.<br>
Adamantium: And advanced form of Neutronium armour. Five times as hard for only twice the weight. (MUST HAVE NEUTRONIUM HYPERTECHNOLOGY)<br>
Distort Shields: Holographic forcefields that register as “solid” on sensors making targeting you harder.<br>
Dampening Shields: Advanced shields designed to reduce the incoming damage severely. <br>
Displacer Shields: Completely teleports the ship 50 metres from a significant threat. No use against blast weapons. Only works 70% of the time. (MUST HAVE DAMPENING SHIELDS AND DISTORT SHIELDS)<br>
Energjax: A unique trans-dimensional energy excellent for reactors, beam weapons, Omega weapons and engines.<br>
Gravitational Sensors: Senses targets by gravity waves defeating most cloaking devices.<br>
High Power Sensors: Also known as “high detail” while they operate on the same ranges as normal sensors and the like the HP sensors provide much more detail.<br>
<br>
Faults/Weaknesses: (Each Fault, Weakness or Flaw allows you to take one more trait in any category EXCEPT for Historical or Hyper-Advanced. No more than three may be chosen.)<br>
Honourable to a fault: Your strategies will never rely on surprise or deception, your ships are painted bright shiny silver and your admirals will always give a speech to the enemy before battle.<br>
Creaky Military: The military is under-budgeted, under-equipped and underfed. Kind of like the Russian fleet circa 1995. You simply don't have much in the way of a military. This flaw hits hard enough to provide two (2) bonus traits.<br>
There Is No Internet: Your computers and electronics are like 2000s vintage. This sucks.<br>
Third World: Even in the future, the third world is not known for technological superiority. While not as horrible as There Is No Internet, it's far more broad-based. Kiss your shields and artificial gravity good-bye for everything but the flagship.<br>
Soylent Green Is People!: You have a giant elephant-sized skeleton in your closet. (You must describe this big nasty secret. Though only your nation knows it and even the best spies would have difficulty finding it.<br>
Government Red Tape: This request cannot be processed at this time. Please take a number.<br>
Cult Of {Keyword}: All Hail Xenu!<br>
Hilariously Fail: Someone - a lot of someones - doesn't have much going on upstairs. Unfortunately they're disproportionately represented in your government and military.<br>
Public Outcry: Your people have deep and strong opinions on some issues you'd really rather they didn't.<br>
Wimpy: Maybe they're a low-gravity race or just didn't drink milk when growing up. No matter the cause, your people are short, skinny and weak. This is a bigger disadvantage than it sounds, as your fighter pilots will not be able to handle nearly as many Gs and your ships will likewise be relatively sluggish.<br>
Paranoia!: In a universe full of planet-destroying aliens, a healthy dose of paranoia is only natural. It might make diplomacy difficult but at least they won't sneak up on you!<br>
Trade Dependent: Exactly what it says. A good example is a Mars-like world that must import significant food to feed its populace.<br>
Psychic Nulls: Something in the (recent?) past has eliminated any trace of psychic ability from your population, probably botched genetic tinkering. While this doesn't affect their quality of life, it does mean that you're an open book to any telepath and probably find neural interfaces difficult to use.<br>
<br>
SPECIAL TRAIT!:<br>
Each person may create one special trait for themselves to represent their people as a whole. As such it cannot be a technologically oriented trait.<br>
Example would include “Corruptor”: The *species name* has a knack for infiltrating and corrupting other species populace bringing them into the *empire name*s fold via subversive means often using Religious or Philosophical methods.. NOTE: Special Traits are to be totally unique NOT as a method of going “I’m better than you are” at something. It is to reflect your peoples methods and ways of doing things.<br>
<br>
<b><u>MILITARIES!:</u></b><br>
In this one your militaries are pure fluff, but it should be noted, a Medium Nation will have a weaker military than a large, a small nation will have a weaker military than both, but three small nations working together could force a single large nation to stalemate.<br>

</div>Yeah, when it comes to weaknesses the Bulls and Vermin are very similar but for different reasons. <br>

			Nation Name: Karminites<br>
<br>
Species: 'Flights' -Karminites are human-shaped, but are distinctly avian. THEY DO NOT HAVE BEAKS, however, they have beaky faces and look a little 'sharp' around the edges. They are covered in a thin coating of feathers and have three head-feathers that erect when they are frightened, suprised, or exited (like cockatoos). They also have prominent tail feathers. Along the inside of their arms are long wing-feathers that can be folded back when not in use. While not nessessaraly being able to fly, Karminites are able to glide quite long distances, and they can jump really high for takeoff. Their 'species personality' is widly ranged. here are some nice Karminites, and some mean Karminites, and some smart Karminites, and some stupid Karminites (you get the picture). Just like us humans here on earth. <img src="./34778-The-Burning-Void-(Scifi-Nations-OOC)_files/677b8.gif" border="0" alt="" title="Smile" class="inlineimg"><br>
<br>
Advantage: Three Dimensional. Up and Down is just a more vertical way of saying Right to Left.<br>
Disadvantage: Fragile. Hollow bones are not built to withstand high G's.<br>
<br>
(ha, and i just realized that flights get the lowest population per point (400 mil), besides crystals. Dont know if thats good or bad...<br>
------------------------------------<br>
Nation size: Small. 50 points to spend.<br>
<br>
Advantage: A small nation has a tighter structure and strength, its administration issues go through more smoothly and has less red tape more importantly they are harder to infiltrate with spies and more skilled at defending their own territories. <br>
Disadvantage: The more compact nature of a Small Nation can work against it in time of war. While they are skilled at defending their territories against loss they <br>
<br>
cannot afford to actually lose much. As such they are more susceptible to political threat.<br>
------------------------------------<br>
I obtain one Rich system. Lots of nebula contrails and a few asteroids here and there. Most of the planets have undergone terraforming to make them inhabitable. (since it's unlikely that 8 planets in one system are ALL capable of supporting life.) (15 pts)<br>
<br>
Capital- Karmineopolis (10 pts)<br>
Agricultural- Joleenia (2 pts)<br>
Agricultural- Franziskat (2 pts)<br>
Agricultural- Chursee (2 pts)<br>
Research- Artemaopolis (4 pts)<br>
Training- Fegieshfairegyro (5 pts)<br>
Mining- Mitaness (4 pts)<br>
Pleasure World Good- Varselelin (6 pts)<br>
<br>
 one point left... (spent on a trait)<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Government: A benevolent dictatorship. One man's word is Law, but luckly that man has the best interests of the people in mind.<br>
<br>
People of Importance:<br>
Artema Karmine-The dictator of the Karminite empire. He took over a long time ago and seems to be ageless. (Hes the only one that seems ageless, other Karminites usually have a lifespan of about 80 years) He wears the symbol of the empire, a upside-down triangular mask with slits in it, on the lower half of his face. He is totally focused on improving the empire, and you better not tell him otherwise. (If you've read the Discworld books by Terry Pratchett, then think Lord Vetinari. If you havn't read them, then shame on you!) His only flaw is that he has trouble naming things (all the planets and cities are named after someone he knows, or himself). He also is the only Karminite ever, in all of Karminite history, to have psyonic abilities.<br>
<br>
Franziska Karmine-Artema's wife. She runs the judicial system of the empire and is a sounding board for all of Artema's troubles. She dotes on him, and would do anything for him, but she's a bit worried that the ruling of an empire is taking its tole on him.<br>
<br>
Varselel Karmine-Artema and Franziska's daugter. She's only 17, so she dosn't do much yet in the way of ruling, however, she is taking a keen interest in diplomacy and will probably be a main emmissianary one day. She is an optomist, and has an endearing voice and mannerisims. The Dark Clerks often take her on diplomicy trips because she has a way of softining up the other side. Sometimes annoying.<br>
<br>
Cloac Gyro-Leader of the Dark Clerks, an organization that specilizes in beauacracy and diplomacy. They move the paper around in ways that are almost magical in there efficincey. Cloac is Artema's secretary, and his entire existance is to file folders of paperwork.<br>
<br>
Priestess Jolene Nia-Leader of the Artema Cult, she is also second in command (first is Artema) of the KSP (Karmine Space Force). She is very flighty, and will only commit to somthing if she as full backing from Artema first. Dosn't know how to handel herself if she gets into a desprate situation.<br>
<br>
Darkbeat-Leader of the biggest pirate cartel in the entire galaxy, and somewhat a kind of programmer (he invented the THIEF system). Most of the galaxy's black market comes through Karminite space, because of the lax customs laws. Because of this, Darkbeat usually has a lot of money flowing through his hands. While obviously corrupt, (he's just a criminal, not a Artema cultist) he tends to manage the cartel well enough.<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
National Traits:<br>
<br>
Komitet Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti: The Dark Clerks are watching. Waiting.<br>
Implausibly Efficient Government: The Clerks are also doing their more obvious job. Filing files. And crushing the hopes and dreams of luckless interns.<br>
Cargo Cultist: Pirates cant usually afford warships. Demand comes supply...<br>
Who Cares About Uzbekistan: Even though Karminites are practically running the black market, any non-criminal dosent really know this. Or about Karminites at all. They're kind of a criminal legend, the Billy the Kid of the Galaxy.<br>
<br>
Population Traits:<br>
<br>
Loyalty: 'As thick as thieves,' I think the term is...<br>
Eureka!: Current studies show that Karminites have all the sudden gotten a lot smarter.<br>
Hard Workers: You gotta SWEAT to make it work!<br>
SPACE MARINES!: Intense training, combined with natural fast reflexes and a disposition towards flight, make some pretty friggen awesome pilots.<br>
<br>
Military Traits:<br>
<br>
Ninja Space pirate: Betcha can't guess what this one is about <img src="./34778-The-Burning-Void-(Scifi-Nations-OOC)_files/00vlY.gif" border="0" alt="" title="Big Grin" class="inlineimg"><br>
Armament De-Regulation: Time to whip out those dorsal-mounted quad-cannons.<br>
Network-Paradigm Processor: Darkbeat invented the THIEF (Thermic High Information Economic Files) system that uses tempature to store and transfer huge amounts of data at once, and then he promptly sold it to the military. Of course, he still has a copy...<br>
<br>
<br>
Technical Traits:<br>
<br>
Plug'n'Play: A gun is a gun, and can be attached anywhere. So can practically anything else. Makes ships highly customizeable.<br>
Flash: Karminite ships' teeth, if they could smile (or had teeth) would catch the light and go *ting.*<br>
Better Than Your Sensors: The eagle eye is not only organically in a Karminite, but is reflected in its ships sensors, too. Yes. We can see you.<br>
Stealth Obsessed: Perfect for ambushes.<br>
<br>
History Trait: <br>
<br>
Exodites- Despite several attempts at diplomacy with other species and even with the pirate part of the Karminite population, many people do not like their stuff stolen, for some reason. As such, Karminites are used to packing up and leaving in a hurry.<br>
<br>
Hyper-Technology Traits:<br>
<br>
Reaper Drive: From here to there. Forget all this relitivity crap. Hyper-Waveform is so last year.<br>
Antimatter: Harvested from the Negitive Zone, Antimatter goes boom when combined with matter. Useful to know.<br>
Energjax: Go too far into the Negitive Zone and you get this green stuff. Not only is it a refreshing drink, but it can power just about anything!<br>
Omega: <font size="5">BANG!</font><br>
<br>
National Flaws:<br>
<br>
Artema Cult: Artema used this orginization during his takeover of Karminopolis. His followers worshiped him and fought for the 'saving of our race!' It was mostly drivin by false propoganda, and even though Artema stopped trying to develop it after his power base was complete, they are still the number one religion in the empire. One of the main reasons it was popular is because it caters to a criminal mind. Namely pirates.<br>
<br>
Psychic Nulls: Artema is technically a freak of nature. Karminites have NEVER shown psionic ability before.<br>
<br>
Special trait:<br>
Arr, Matey!- Pirates, pirates, and moar pirates! The criminal cartels of Karminite space have connections with other black markets all over the galaxy, even with other species. You'd be amazed how far away a pirate can roam from home in search of a great deal on the lastest load...<br>

<br>
These are my begining ships. I used the shipbuilding rules from the old one as a guideline, kad, but embellished a little. I never spent any Industrial points in the old one (i was saving up), so I think I could have a bigger fleet than last time (sort of a credit transfer). Are these ships approved?<br>

8 planitary shields<br>

<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Ok, there it is. Hevily modified, with all-new discriptions of the traits (tried to make them funnyish) and some other new factoids (in other words, please read and approve, kad. Please?) . i focused more on pirates, since i liked playing as the galactic bad guy, flying under the radar with Uzbekistan.<br>
<br>
I'll make ships later, probably tomorrow. (or today, since its midnight.)<br>
<br>
Is there gonna be an OOB for this? And can I use my last planetary point on another trait? I know they dont matter much, but i like them because they describe your civilizations achievments, all neat and catagorized.
