<font size="3"><i>In this world, there are humans who have an unusual gift; a power that lets them morph one or more of their body parts into the form similar to an animal's. <br>
<br>
Some are capable of growing wings. <br>
<br>
Others are even capable of full body changes. <br>
<br>
These transformations occur at will, but when inactive, the morphed areas revert back to normal, leaving the person's clothing and body completely untouched. The only visual mark of this ability appears on the body of the person, in the form of a black mark that resembles a tattoo-like symbol. All Shadows are <b>born</b> as Shadows, but some don't know they are until their late childhood to late teens. For those who just found their Shadows, it is most commonly caused by the threat of danger, their animal side taking over to help them escape or fight. <br>
<br>
People fear the Shadows as great monsters, though; not all accept these people, and as an Shadows, many have, and will, face hard times. <br>

It is all-season country, known for its farming and merchants, and has been neutral in most wars that have happened outside of it; inside? That’s a different story entirely. Edin is also well-known for its high population count of Shadows. The technology of Edin resembles that of the medieval era, with better plumbing and more science, and Edin just happens to be going through a time of great prosperity. </div>

    <div>
        <div class="hider" style="display: none;">The number of wars Edin has fought in are so few in numbers that one can count them all with a single hand, but the ones they have fought in are far more important than many realize, earning the name The Great Five Wars. They are as follows; the Bloodless War, the Empty War, the Death War, the War of Shadows, and the Liberties War.<br>
<br>
But a little background doesn’t hurt; the creation of Edin was many centuries ago (almost as far back as to be unable to remember how Edin started); Virtute, the capital, was born, and the birth of Edin began. Almost immediately, an elite class of warriors—from their once nomadic group—declared themselves leaders of Edin, saying they would rule as an oligarchy over this land (they refused the idea of a kingdom, but that’s a story for another time). <br>
<br>
That is how the Bloodless War began—some fought against the idea of the oligarchy ruling them, and others were with it. It earned the name “Bloodless War” for the simple fact that it was nearly bloodless; a total of two battles were fought in the Virtute (and those were mere skirmishes compared to the battles of other wars), with number of causalities only being a hundred out of the ten thousand people who lived there. It was named “Bloodless” because the War began and ended with words; political battles that they fought, the Table of Edin (as the oligarchy declared themselves) against the Chair of Virtute (as the monarchy, the opposing side, declared themselves). While many think it false, the Bloodless War only last two years; the number of followers the Chair of Virtute had dwindled until the point of only having a thousand followers out of ten thousand, collapsing in on itself until finally they surrendered to the Table of Edin, and the oligarchy was declared Edin’s government (but others believe that spies were sent into the Chair of Edin, corrupting the highest of the high and—well, a story for another time, that is).<br>
<br>
The Empty War began with the invasion from Acoustria, ten years after the Bloodless War; the country threatened to take their land and enslave them all if they did not surrender immediately. Edin did not—and it was, in fact, a short war, barely longer than ten months; Acoustria faced so many losses that surrendered and gave a portion of its land over to Edin as sign of peace, hoping it would make up for the dead they had both lost. It was dubbed the “Empty” War because Edin only lost a total of a thousand men in the few battles it had, while Acoustria lost more than half its army and more, although some call it the “Outer” War. <br>
<br>
The third War, the bloodiest of all the Five Great Wars Edin has fought, is the Death War—Edin had begun to expand its land, going farther and farther out until it reached a large group of states—seven total, calling themselves Noctis—two hundred years after the Empty War. When Edin explorers stumbled upon the Noctis, at first they were confused—who were these people? Why did they resemble animals more than people? They could shift their body into those of an animal, run as fast as the ones they represent—it was astounding! <br>
<br>
This is where the origins of the Shadows are first documented; with the Noctis. But the Noctis lineage of beast and human went farther back then the people of Edin realized—before they had even created Virtute, or even thought to settle where they had. Explorers—and Noctis—were astounded with their opposites so much that by pure accident, battle broke out between the small group and one of the smaller states, causing Edin and Noctis to begin negotiations until another attack occurred on Noctis land by people who wished to rid their land of “monsters”—and it declared war. It was a battle of the ages; it lasted a good fifty years, half battle and half words, negotiations, and threats that were never met, blood spilt on children and parents alike, none able to escape the clutch of Death. <br>
<br>
Thousands were murdered, slaughtered, kidnapped—the worst happened to the best of them, with so many deaths on both sides that the two countries had to declare a temporary truce to create a treaty, simply because if they lost anymore soldiers, they were sure to be destroyed in no more than ten years. The treaty—called the treaty of Lost Lives—is lost in the Archives, but it is said that because of it, no citizen of the country could venture into opposite territory, on penalty of death by their home country. <br>
<br>
What caused the two to combine lands was the War of Shadows, only three years later—a small group of ten Noctis citizens ventured into Edin territory—it is said that they did it by “accident”—and were slaughtered because of their strange, animal-like characteristics that many of the Edinish citizens had never seen. Two were of bear, one was of fox, three were of horse, and the rest were of mice. Nearly on sight they were murdered, as the treaty, people believe, stated—but Noctis declared that the men who had killed their citizens be executed, for it violated the very treaty that stood. Edin refused—and even killed the messengers Noctis had sent to negotiate. War broke out, and the War of Shadows began. <br>
<br>
It only lasted five years; Noctis was forced to surrender to Edin, unable to fight any longer after losing nearly half of its small country to the war. Edin completely took over Noctis after ignoring it’s plea for a truce, declared it Edin territory, destroyed the boundaries between the states—and made all Noctis citizens slaves, except for the state leaders, who were executed as criminals of the country. And so more territory was gained, and the history of Shadows began their own part in the Archives (you will find that over half the books in the Archive of Virtute were written by Shadow slaves—and not all were on the terrible trials of slavery, but were also, in fact, on their biology and science).<br>
<br>
 A hundred years passed after the end of the War of Shadows—sixty years before present day—before the final war, the Liberties War, began with the attack on Edin citizens by the “Shadows”—free or runaway slaves from the Noctis land, tired of their imprisonment and the lock on their animal sides, and known for fighting in the dark of night and that their shadows, even in human form, represent those of their shifted side. The Shadows, a group of fifty, after killing half a village of farmers, managed to escape into uncharted territory and begin a rebellion against the Table of Edin—a feat many had tried to meet, but failed. Over the span of eight years, slaves were being rescued by the “Shadows” from all over the country, even so far north as the Levestrian forest. A total of ten battles were fought—the first with the village, and the rest in the uncharted territory. The Table of Edin was astounded when they began to actually lose battles by the fifth one; by the seventh, they had lost half their army to the Shadows, and more than a million slaves went “missing” because of this group.  <br>
The Liberties War only lasted four years, coming to a conclusion when the Shadows decided to take pity on the Table of Edin and its country. The rebellion sent a hundred soldiers with ten messengers to negotiate a treaty (with an unknown number waiting along the border) stating that if the Edinish agreed to the terms they provided, the War would be over. Although not all the terms are known—the treaty is, in fact, in the Archives, as the Shadows of the present day would revolt if it was discovered that their only sign of freedom was lost—it is fact that the Shadows demanded an end to the slavery of the once Noctis people, citizen rights given to them, and compensation for the loss of their ancestors freedom. Whether all the terms were met or not is not really known—only those who thoroughly studied the Treaty know it—but what is fact is that the Table of Edin did negotiate and sign the treaty, after a few months of debate. <br>
<br>
And an end to the Liberties War was met; the Shadows were given their freedom, an Edin moved its territory farther on until it reached the ocean shore and the border of Chyben (a rogue nation that often went to war against Acoustria). Over the last forty-eight years, the people of the animal marks, of Noctis, were given the name “Shadows” in honor of those who fought for the freedom; and although they did have freedom, they are still prejudiced against, a part of their lives that the former Shadows could not have foreseen.<br>
<br>
There are rumors of a group, hidden in the Levestrian forest (the Acoustrian and Edin border), that wish to overthrow and destroy the Table of Edin and end the rule of it, take over, and declare the land as Noctis land—bringing back the Old Ways and true freedom to all Shadows.<br>
<br>
But of course, these are only rumors. And the chances of meeting them are so very, very slim. </div>
    </div>
</div><br>
The Five Great Wars are truly the basic past of Edin; every single one was fought to define the country more, until it reached the point it is today. And a fine one it is, isn't it?  <br>

    <div>
        <div class="hider" style="display: none;">Although the mortals of Edin—people who do not possess the ability to shift their limbs into that of an animal, who lack the ability of a Shadow—believe otherwise, the people of Noctis brought more than labor and dirty lineage to their country. They brought over half of the scientific theories of the day, even building half the technology that the Edinish believe to have “created”; and with their science, theories on the Shadows and why they have this “strange” ability were brought also, expanded upon by both Shadows and mortals alike.<br>
<br>
Mortals and Shadows have tried to figure out what has caused this ability—is it fear? Something that has happened in a past life? Death?—and the conclusion they have met most often is <i>anger</i>, or their beings being threatened by some force. But that conclusion isn’t set in stone just yet—others were born with their Shadows, and some don’t even touch theirs until a random day, when they might have been strolling down the block and suddenly produced the legs of a horse. <br>
<br>
Another question in the science department; can you <i>lose</i> your Shadow? And the answer; yes. You can. The reasons why, like the theories of how to gain a shadow, are not clear; it can be a wish fulfilled because of your shadow, pure hate for it, or never truly using it. Tests have been done on the tattoo-like birthmarks of the Shadows, with such terrible results—the loss of ten scientists after a bird Shadow attacked them for damaging his birthmark—that it is believed to actually <i>enforce</i> the mental need of a shadow to the Shadow. Another guess, with better test results, is when the bearer of a Shadow differs too far from their very shadow; a vulture shadow, for example, would have the urges to scavenge more so than that of a dear shadow. But, if the vulture shadow was placed in a high class home, with food and drink at his beck and call, why, what would be the point of having to scavenge? And so he will force down the urges, and, eventually, lose that shadow from lack of use and change in personality. <br>
<br>
But then the question , “How do I gain it back?” rises; and that, scientists have found, is uncharted territory. Very few of actually gained their shadow back—and more often than not, it was the exact same one they had before. It is near impossible to gain an entirely new shadow, simply because the shadow you had was, in the best term possible, compatible with you and your wishes, beliefs, traits, and other minor attributes; simply gaining a new one is certainly believed impossible. <br>
<br>
Whether or not one can so easily lose their shadow—it may take years, or just a few days—is also unknown, for scientists and Shadows alike find that no matter what they do, all shadows have different traits that can lead to different results. </div>

We start off in the Capital, Virtute, where you meet your Fate—maybe discovering at long last you are a Shadow, or learning to control or hide the Shadow you’ve lived with your whole life—and other Shadows, with their own dark pasts to run from, or futures to embrace. Something will send you--and the others--from the city and into the open roads, to travel wherever the wind takes you, with your Shadow following you, protecting and guiding you when you yourself cannot.</font><br>

<br>
Well, of course, you have your <i>own</i> plot line; but basically, it’s a continuous RP where you, as a Shadow, face challenges here and there. The main plot is basically your own; you don’t HAVE to focus on anyone else’s, really. Unless you want to. Be it getting used to your new powers, finding a new home, or hunting down a man/woman who killed a loved one, it's all up to you. <br>
<br>
As GM, I’ll be putting obstacles in the way for you guys; maybe military problems, people who want to kill you, murderers…or, y’know, fluffy bunnies. Whatever floats my boat :3 but I won’t be creating a character for myself. I’ll be all the NPCs, the bad guys, the natural disasters, and whoever else to keep this thing going. My posting may be often or may be rare; if we hit a bump, I’ll put up a post; if everything’s going super-duper well, and I’m not needed, I’ll be spamming the OOC while reading your posts. <br>
<br>
But along with that, I’ll have a few dominant characters that’ll keep coming back—I don’t want to be COMPLETELY NPCs—to add drama and challenges to your group of travelers. <br>
<br>
My other role is taking people out of the RP if they haven’t posted for a while, but more details on that in the posting rules.</div>

        <div class="hider" style="display: none;">Yes, yes, we WILL have an order. It’s nothing constricting, though. I swear.<br>
<br>
Anyway, this RP will be a continuous one; RPers will come and go, some old, and some new. If you leave for three weeks, you can come back after; if you disappear from loss of interest, but wish to come back some time later, by all means, come back! No characters are denied after acceptance. <br>
<br>
Now, as to posting; after everyone posts for the first time, I’ll devise an order in which we post (sometimes I may skip myself, but the chances of that happening are rare) and once started, the first person posts, and we begin the order. If a person on the list who is next doesn’t post in TWO DAYS, we skip them—and they have the next eight days to post at anytime and catch up. Or, if need be, write and exit for their character if they lose interest.<br>
<br>
(IT IS ABSOLUTELY OKAY TO LOSE INTEREST. I SWEAR. I’LL JUST CRY ON THE INSIDE A LITTLE BIT, OKAY? SO PLEASE TELL ME.) <br>
<br>
After those ten days (two for posting, eight for after those two) I will personally take that character out of the RP in my own way, and put them on the Waiting list (for anyone else who wishes to join) as “Absent”. Cool so far?<br>
<br>
So that brings about the Waiting List; basically, people who show interest and don’t mind waiting for a spot. Simple, yeah? Yeah. </div>

And finally (I SWEAR THIS IS IT…)<br>
<b>RULES OF OOC/IC</b><br>
<br>
<u>OOC</u><br>
    1.) If someone insults you, you will argue in PMs, not my OOC. That wastes space and brings unnecessary attention to yourself that no one wants. <br>
    2.)	You have a problem with me, you PM me. Don’t post and waste space in the OOC because of how much of a bitch you think I am. It’s happened before. <br>
    3.)	Questions I haven’t answered? Ask ‘em.<br>
<br>
<u>IC</u><br>
1.)	All OOC STAYS in OOC. Seriously, no (hey, lol, what’s up?) during the posts please.<br>
2.)	Minimum of three paragraphs. No less, more is appreciated.<br>
3.)	Swearing? Keep it to a minimum. <br>
4.)	No godmodding. THAT’S a given.<br>
5.)	Romance IS allowed. Just keep all M things in PM. <br>
6.)	If you have questions for me, or are confused about something I wrote in the IC, ask me! I swear I don’t bite!<br>

    <div>
        <div class="hider" style="display: none;">To legally travel through the cities of Edin, one most form a traveling group and register at the city or town hall, where a map is given (based on your destination) and supplies that should last you the journey to the next city or town. On arrival of their destination, the travelers can go their separate ways—either to stay in the city, or head to the “Journeyer” station, where they will get a new map, based on destination, and supplies for the travel there. <br>
<br>
By government law, the group must be assigned a Protector to accompany them on their travels. When this system was first brought about, a new Protector was assigned—from the Journeyer station—to the group that was a government official, and would journey back to their city once the group reached their destination. Times have changed, and the new, more economic way of having a Protector is having a person in the group being assigned as Protector. <br>
<br>
Requirements that a protector should meet would be prior fighting experience, over the age of thirty, a form of connection to the government (postal worker, guard, etc.). <br>
<br>
For the RP: something will happen (what it is, that’s your decision, so long as it gets you to the Journeyer station) that will force you to leave the city and travel to another; a Protector will be assigned by ME based on the first two posts everyone puts in. And as for what I will do with my NPCs...well, you'll see soon enough! </div>

Name: Rakven Talonbeak<br>
Age: 40<br>
Gender: Male<br>
Shadow: Falcon<br>
--Tattoo: Two feathers that intertwine around one another like snakes.<br>
<br>
Personality<br>
<br>
Flaws – Easily agitated, highly territorial, somewhat greedy, and animalistic in his intellectual pursuits, a social invalid in general.<br>
Virtues – Kindhearted, protective, and calm whenever possible.<br>
<br>
Appearance: Rakven looks a bit older than his age. His hair black with random streaks of white across it, and his narrow eyes gray and cold, he appears calm and sophisticated. All this added to his crooked nose only furthers the already birdlike features he possesses. His body is muscular and lean other than the wrinkles on his forehead. Because of all the hard work over time, his hands are usually covered in calluses.<br>
<br>
Biography:<br>
<br>
Although people could never tell by simply looking at him, Rakven had been born a rich man; to a family of merchants no less! During the early years of his childhood, the boy discovered the uncontrollable desire to hunt and kill his prey, and prey was a very loose term in those days. It started at mice and cats, as he slowly worked his way up to the dogs on his father’s estate. There was no stopping him. After a while, the killing alone was not enough and Rakven found himself wanting to eat everything he had captured. At first he would cook his meals, but after a while, nothing but raw meat could satisfy his urges.<br>
<br>
The boy grew and so did his needs and instincts. Once after a fight had gone south his father found him covered in blood of one servant. However, what interested his father the most was not the death of the servant… they were easily replaced after all. No, it was the question that his sick mind had asked itself countless times before. Why had his son gotten the power to shift into an animal, why did that legendary power not pass onto him instead? The questions kept popping up and after a while, it was no longer possible to evade talking about it. Rakven told his father everything. He told him how he could extend his nose into a bill whenever he so wished, that his hands and feet would occasionally turn into talons when he got angry, and finally what intrigued his father most… sometimes Rakven could feel the wind in his arms, and feathers would begin to grow out on them, almost forcing him into the sky. He had never mastered this ability completely, but that did nothing to mend his father’s jelaousy.<br>
<br>
In his late teens, the boy’s appetite was so great that he had stopped stalking his own estate for prey and started heading out into the nearby forest to hunt. Prideful and arrogant beyond measure, he refused to acknowledge any possible dangers he could face once out of the secure lands of his father. On one such occasion, an arrow flew from somewhere and hit one of his giant wings. Probably a hunter who was trying to get a big trophy to carry home to, or one of those shadow haters that father often spoke of… it mattered not, because all he could think about at that moment was falling. Falling and dying. With last inches of his fading strength he managed to collapse on his doorstep, but his troubles did not end there. Apparently, he had lost a lot of blood and trying to fly all the way home only worsened it. As a servant was dressing the wound, his father came forward and touched it. It was not a harmful touch, but something animalistic in Rakven quickly sprung out and his father was on the floor. At first he twitched a bit and then he just stopped. The servant ran out screaming for help, but he never got around to waiting for it to come.<br>
<br>
The boy started to run, and somewhere on that run he became a man. Finally he settled after a long time and made a home for himself in a small city by the coast. Fishing was not his passion, but it provided him with both food and currency, and that was all he needed… for a while anyway. After a few years of loneliness, he met his current wife and they got married quickly after. The woman had given him three sons and four daughters. They have been living together for 15 years now.</div>

        <div class="hider" style="display: none;"> Name: Tobias Malley<br>
Gender: Male<br>
Age: 24<br>
Shadow: Alligator<br>
--Tattoo: Tribal markings of gator prints on both his shoulder blades.<br>
Personality:<br>
<br>
Tobias’s personality is hard to explain because like his shadow, you never know what lurks beneath an alligator’s eyes. He is content with the simple things of life: the affections of a woman, water for drinking and swimming, sun absorbed though his body, and freedom. He was raised to be a social creature so he enjoys being in a crowd even if his shadow doesn’t. Friendly to everyone, he is only truly open to those he knows and has history with.<br>
<br>
He can speak prefect English but he prefers to ignore his h’s making him seem less educated to most folks. Tobias slips form this only in the company and he must make his meaning very clear. Then again he only steps in when he feels it is needed to prevent bloodshed. Another bad habit is the tenancy to drift off into space when someone speaks unless he deems it important or want to listen, making him freeze. He claims it’s because he uses sunlight to re-energize when he is caught at it.<br>
<br>
He can’t stand the cold, due to being a reptile he falls slowly into a deep sleep but to work though this weakness of his, he exposes himself to cold climates or fridge conditions whenever possible. It has helped in his endurance but not completely vanquished it. So in the harsh change in temperature his speech slows and form struggles to stay awake. As a whole, he comes off as a laid back, polite, extremely patient and mostly silent unless spoken to. He only becomes aggressive when threaten and calm once the danger is gone, reverting only to his shadow when he is out matched or need to.<br>
<br>
Appearance:<br>
<br>
When in human form, Tobias is a dark Native American skinned man built for speed and endurance rather than the thick muscles for strength alone. His height is average at 5’ 9” and weights about 145 pounds. He has chestnut brown eyes that can slit like his reptile counterpart in a flash of rage. His torso and legs are covered with scars of previous show fights, displays of his recklessness and occupational hazards. Only one scar stands out, a sword wound across his left eye from the cheek to bottom of his brow. His dark black hair is long, tied up in a ponytail ending below his shoulder blades.<br>
<br>
Biography:<br>
He was born a farmer’s son, loved at first sight and very much wanted. Sadly it was never meant to be as on the very day after his birth, men came knocking on the door, greedy neighbors who turned upon the man once his hand opened the door. Any weapon from sharpened pole and sickles to shears and pick forks mutilated the body, all over a dispute about land boundaries that had escalated into violence. His mother witness the brutality making it necessary to execute her as she fled with her babe into the woods, yells and dim torch light in her wake. In the end the farmer’s wife took the wicker basket and laid it into the stream-prayed her young son would survive- before meeting the men’s lust for blood head on. The last thing Tobias would faintly remember would be the forest filled with shadows of men and a thrashing alligator locked in battle.<br>
<br>
Tobias was told he was found in a wicker basket sent down the stream before his adopted mother, Rita, found him. She loved him on first sight, from his rough skin to his silted eyes as she made her way to place he would belong for a long time: a traveling circus. Very few of them were shadows, four to be exact, but each and every one of them a freak never the less. His mother, a woman of great skill with a sword, raised him with the rest of the troupe like a great family. When he was twelve, his shadow made it appearance that would forever haunt Tobias and the circus.<br>
<br>
It was a day like any other, his routine to build his muscles carrying supplies from place to the storage caravan when a stowaway made her appearance. A child of eight, only four years younger than himself, thumped into him unexpectedly causing him a start. That was all it seemed to take. Tobias blocked out the memory but the evidence left on his body made it more than clear. His snout coated in a rustic tinge, ribbons of flesh upon his teeth, and the tattered remains of child clothing beneath his claws. It was hidden but everyone knew since he wasn’t the only one with blood on his claws and the truth was hidden away, forgotten. To this day he is still with that circus, an accomplished swordsman and showman attraction within his great family.</div>

        <div class="hider" style="display: none;">Name: Rask<br>
Gender: Male<br>
Age: 32<br>
Shadow: Kimodo Dragon<br>
--Tattoo:<br>
<br>
It covers his entire back, the tail stretching down his left leg to his knee where it wraps around, the head "resting" on his neck on the right, and both of the front claws "grasping" his shoulders.<br>
<br>
Personality: Cold, vicious, and merciless in battle, Rask is not one to give his trust lightly. In fact, he has never really trusted anyone, though he does expect people to do what they say they will. While not exactly evil, his life has made him somewhat jaded when it comes to killing, and he feels no guilt when he does so.<br>
<br>
Appearance:<br>
Slightly over average height, he has a lean, agile build. He has a single scar on his face, running across his right eye. His hair is black, and cut in a military style. While not exactly handsome, many would say that he has sort of rugged good looks. However, the near-constant scowl on his face tends to make him look more intimidating than attractive. His skin is deeply tanned, though not as much as when in his Shadow aspect. His clothing is the same as in the photo, only with more earthy colors. It fits loosely on him in his human form, to allow for his change in size when he transforms.<br>
When in his Shadow aspect, he grows several inches in height, though most of it is in his legs. His limbs become longer, he grows a tail, fangs, and talons, and his skin becomes scales.<br>
<br>
Biography: An oddity even among Shadows, Rask was born in his Shadow aspect. His mother died giving birth to him, and his father sold him as an exotic pet lizard to a rich merchant. He only took on his human form for the first time when he was four, at which point he was immediately dumped on the streets. From there, he learned to take care of himself, through a combination of theft and using his Shadow aspect to hunt when needed.<br>
<br>
When he hit his teen years, he was finally caught stealing, and taken before the courts for his crime. When asked, he chose to become an indentured servant instead of go to jail. His plan had been to escape his new 'master' when he finally got there, only to have that ruined when the owner of a gladiatorial arena purchased his bond. For the next fifteen years after that, he slowly earned his freedom, working in his human form as a stand-in fighter whenever no one else could be found, and as a reoccurring 'villain' in his Shadow form during the monthly 'dramatic' battles.<br>
<br>
Finally, he earned his freedom... or so he thought. He was unable to read or write by the time he got out, in his early thirties by then. He could only find work as a bounty hunter, at least for all official purposes. Unofficially, he was little more than a member of the local guard with a bit more freedom when it came to protocol. The bounties he received were a fraction of what they were supposed to be, and only barely enough to live off of. He'd been effectively pinned down by the local government once again, and it took him nearly a year to figure it out. However, he did, eventually, figure it out. </div>

<br>
On his solarplexis and about 10cm wide.<br>
Personality:<br>
Positive: Carefree, laidback, easygoing, loves moonshine more then anything and is willing to kill for it (potentially negative trait).<br>
Negative: Disloyal, lazy, lack of opinion on everything apart from moonshine, Aggressive when roused.<br>
Appearance:<br>
<br>
A tall, stocky man with quick muscles and a slightly pointed face. Wears next to nothing due to his own vanity but expresses it in no other way then his open, sleeveless vest (leather of course) and a row of twisted teeth dangling idly on a piece of crude neck jewellery.<br>
Biography: Raised from childhood in a rustic, backwater village in the warmer climate of Edin, he learned from a young age that life was nothing more then a process of birth and death. However, his rather lacking wit and young age failed to piece this puzzle together, and instead he readily joined his father's business of showmanship, wrestling and killing wild animals with little more then his bare hands. He understood the risks of such an activity and several large, gashing scars across his back, thighs and arms prove he was good at it.<br>
This almost dream like life, being a local celebrity and enjoying an adventurous lifestyle of danger, ended abruptly as soon as he accidentally rendered his pet dog to pieces using what could only be described a unholy means. His head transformed in a rapid process to that of a large, violent shark.<br>
As you can imagine, he was shocked with this revelation and quickly fled the village in hoped of escaping the persecution of his family and friends, as well as the guilt of killing his dog.<br>
Surprisingly, his lifestyle managed to survive. He continued to work as an entertainer for the more illegal audiences, fighting whatever they threw against him and using his new found abilities to put it down. When the authorities caught on, he fled to the sea, returning days later to travel once more.<br>
Everyday he faces the sunlight with a weary smile and thinks only of the present, never the future.</div>

			@mydadsAsian: no, you can't. Simply because of scitentific reasons--in "theory" it isn't possible to have two shadows because to the mortals, and Shadows, you have crossed a sort of "maximum capacity" and are, quite likely, to go insane.
