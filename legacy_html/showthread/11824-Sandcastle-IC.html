<div style="text-align: center;"><br>
<i>The moon has made place for it's other half.<br>
It shines ever so brightly upon the city of Rayt. <br>
Life wakes slowly, but surely. <br>
It's a small world that never changes. <br>
You open your eyes on the same spot every morning.<br>
You see the same people, time after time. <br>
A man can't truly escape his roots. <br>
He will always return to the place of his birth. <br>
But the people of Rayt are at peace with the familiar. <br>
Only a select few individuals strive for change, freedom and the unknown.</i></div><br>
<br>
<br>
I close the door behind me. The empty streets welcome me and the clouds seem to flee from my sight, as if they fear my arrival. I can see the people who watch me, and every single one of my movements closely. They stare from behind their casings, but it's silent inside the sand-coloured buildings. I want to avoid the drowsy gazes; so I try to leave the houses behind me as soon as I can. The people can see me, but most don't know me. They don't know my name, some don't even know my voice. To them, I am who the person they see, a vivid and self-assured woman passing through the streets at a steady place. <br>
<br>
When this world is lit by the naked sun, the revealed land is somewhat familiar to me, but scary nonetheless. Do I want to go back to the past? No. Probably. Yes. But this present is inescapable and everyone needs to face the music one day. My previous life will continue to linger deep inside of me for a while; casting it away is too difficult. That would be like breaking myself into pieces and I'd rather be a scarred, whole person than a broken one. I am Shula also. <br>
<br>
I dare to step in parts of the city I only vaguely remember, which I consider very brave of myself. Shula would never set foot in such a neighbourhood and that's the proof I have the upper hand. She stares through my eyes, but doesn't have a word to protest with. I can feel her shiver with every step I take, my own body remains calm and gracefully moves forward. Shula clamps on to me, Lamya, a person who is largely unfamiliar to her, but she trusts her and silently accepts everything she does.<br>
<br>
It has been seven years since I lived in this world. I was a sixteen-year-old girl when I left and now am a full-grown woman, twenty-three of age. I've picked the locks of her shackles and am free to go. I just wish Shula's lashes didn't show on my arms. But where can I find a new canvas?

							The sun was already bright enough to narrow the eyes as it passed across the dusty floor through the narrow slit that was the room's only window. Russet gaze snapping open, Khalidah dropped it to settle upon the small object in her tanned palm, a slow smile creeping across her full lips. Tossing the fruit into the air, the dancer caught it deftly, her feet already taking her to the sandy frame that overlooked the dirty streets of Rayt as she bit into the crisp flesh. Few people were out at this hour - here and there a tiny rodent skittered across the sandy paths - and the morning birds twittered raucously as the hot, glowing orb made its way back up the clear skies. <br>
<br>
Squinting into the light, Khalidah reached up with her free hand and lowered the cloak-like burnoose from her head, running her slender fingers through her tangled, sand-encrusted locks in an attempt to loosen the knots within the dark curls. The effort - as always - did nothing and, with a sigh, Khalidah turned from the window, tossing the hard pit from her stolen fruit out onto the street below. Crouching, the young woman rummaged through an old sack hidden unobtrusively in the corner, her slim hand emerging a few moments later with a comb made of bone, many of the teeth broken and jagged but still nonetheless usable. Dragging the remaining teeth through her hair, Khalidah returned to her observations of the street, dark gaze flashing quickly over the few people below as she thought.<br>
<br>
Eventually, after some moment of contemplation, her ebony curls were untangled once more and tossing the comb back to its place, Khalidah wrapped the teal-coloured cloth around her face once more. Nothing had changed. Rayt was still its old, dusty self and she... she was no more than a thief and a rogue. Every day began the same and it always would.<br>
<br>
The sand stirred upon the stone floor as the cloaked shadow left without a sound.<br>
<br>
Nothing had changed.

							Matta awoke in the shade of a plam tree, he decided that it must be early morning because he was still protected from the glaring by that familiar tree beneath which he'd woken up every day of his life. he'd had the misfortune to be born in the open and, despite numerous attempts to purchase the spot he'd always been denied his request, largely because public parkland was quite expensive and the Masdar felt a small shack by the oasis would ruin the tranquil nature of the area. The most Matta had managed to acchieve was the planting of the tree under which he lay, unfortunately  it had been positioned wrongly so, unless he woke up early, he would be blinded every morning by the sunlight seeping round the sides of the tree.<br>
<br>
Pushing himself up, his hand slipping slightly and digging into the sand, Matta began the 20 minute journey that would lead him to his deposit box, which he rented out in one of the cheaper Inns near the Oasis. He never told the Innkeeper why he visited the box every morning, suspecting that the man's prices would rise considerably should he find out where his customer woke up each day. Matta arrived eventually at the Inn and, fishing his set of keys out from around his neck, he wordlessly showed one to the Innkeeper who went to unlock the door to the deposit room, knowing that striking up a conversation with Matta this early in the morning wouldn't get him very far.<br>
<br>
Once the door had been unlocked Matta entered, coming out 30 seconds later with some money so that he could fill his gourd with water. Once this was accomplished he went back inside to unpack his gear from the large reddish-brown trunk in which he stored al his worldly posessions. From the box he extracted an expensive looking buzuq and his kaskara, there was no need to travel heavy today so he left it at that, figuring that he would be able to find somewhere to eat later in the day. He relocked the box, and, fishing out some more coins, passed them to the innkeeper and ordered a breakfast.

							Thick droplets of sweat rolled off his forehead into Firouz's eyes, but he did not lift a hand to wipe them away. A large falcon sat on his shoulder, almost leaning against his head, trying fruitlessly to sleep despite the noise Firouz was making. Smiling jovially, his cheeks dimpled as he felt Nasira lean against his ear, and he let out a small chuckle. "Tired, eh Nasira?" he baited, smiling still, "S'your fault, you know." The noise let up for a moment, as Firouz lifted a hand to his face. Using the back of his left hand he wiped the sweat from his brow, and then used his palm to cover his mouth as he coughed against the sparks, three fingers clinging to his cheek against the force of the cough.<br>
<br>
This was the only peace Nasira got, though, as Firouz quickly returned to his work. The heat of the fire, smoke rising quickly into the air above melting with dancing sparks flying off the two pieces of metal he held in his hand- this was Firouz's haven, as well as his profession. The latest order had come to his workshop, and so he was pounding out the last of twelve spikes whilst the others cooled. The workshop, however loved by Firouz it was, had no impact on Nasira, who had clearly expressed her distaste for it many times. These were the times when Firouz needed her sight the most- and also when she was least willing to provide it. The heat was uncomfortable, and with every stroke of the hammer she risked falling off his shoulder.<br>
<br>
Pausing, Firouz looked up at Nasira, and laughed once more at how she had fluffed her feathers. Dropping off the last spike to cool, Firouz stood at the front of his open-aired workshop and looked out into the street. In the streets were all manners of people, because this was the city. This was Rayt. A place where, it seems long ago now, Firouz was born. Where he was born, and where he was found- blinded by his own youthful foolishness. Two bushy eyebrows moved closer as his brown knit, and he turned from the street. He need to see if the first spikes had cooled yet.

							The same familiar backstreets of Rayt, neglected, poverty stricken, filthy... Merchants trying to sell stolen goods in shady corners, pick pockets looking for easy targets, prostitutes, muggers, this place has it all, and it all seems to revolve around crime. Wasim used to like it here, he used to call this place home, but now, while eating breakfast in a shady old tavern near the filthy little back ally that is birthplace, gazing around the backstreets, he can't help but sign in discontent, frustrated by the fact that he is forced to return here, again and again, until the day he dies.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, Wasim stopped eating, and threw an annoyed look at the door, just a moment before it was sprung open by a shady man. The man searched the room, and when his eyes finally laid on Wasim, he smiled and began to walking towards him.<br>
<br>
"Ah Azra'ill! There you are" cried the man, and sat himself in front of Wasim<br>
<br>
"I told you before Abdul, I no longer go by that name…" said Wasim in annoyance while resuming eating his breakfast.<br>
<br>
"Oh don't be so cold Azra'ill, I found a great job for you today!" said the man in a cheerful voice. "It's a woman this time. You love working with women don't you?"<br>
<br>
Wasim raised his eyes from his plate and gave the man a hard, long annoyed look, but the man ignored it.<br>
<br>
"Her name is Shula" said the man and pulled a piece of paper with a sketch of a woman, then pointed at it. "This is her, seems like she angered the wrong man. His willing to give a lot of money to see her dead! And all I ask is just a small share of the profit, for giving you the information of course…"<br>
<br>
Wasim studied the picture of the woman, carefully engraving it in his memory after all, old habits die hard. She seemed young to him, though not too young to be wanted dead, after all he did kill younger woman before. Remembering this irked him. <br>
"I won’t do it" he said in an annoyed voice, "I told you a hundred times already, I don't do these kinds of jobs anymore"<br>
<br>
"Are you sure?" asked Abdul, "There's a lot of money involved here!"<br>
<br>
"Yes I'm certain! Now go away and let me eat in peace!"<br>
<br>
"Fine" said Abdul, getting up, obviously offended "I'll just find another assassin to do the job"<br>
<br>
"Your right" said Wasim, "I can’t just refuse the job. That alone won't do, if the girl is in danger I should find her and help her!" He got up in excitement "After all, isn't this is what a good hearted man would do?"

							“The mark of a beast, I think it fits.” Tamir mumbles with his growling voice while repeatedly running his eyes over my entire body. He awkwardly pauses at the points where my wards reveal my skin. The entire observation feels like a spastic doing. It's good for Tamir he is a rich man, because the ways he looks at and talks to me are disturbing and repelling. <br>
<br>
“Even off the stage, you're an illusionist, Shula. Breaking an elderly man’s heart for your own profit and pleasure. Wipe that crazy smirk of your face, I disgust of you.”<br>
<br>
“Perhaps I am.” I say. The words he speaks are neither unfamiliar nor painful to me. The old man may have been infatuated with me, many men have, but I haven’t felt any devotion to a single one of them. I have loved the thrill and the suspense, the luxury and the wealth, I still do. They offered me all of it, Tamir especially. From my wards to my jewellery, everything I am wearing is his. When I leave his dorms, I will flee on one of his animals, packed with his money and his treasures. He all gave it to me, more than willingly. “But you enjoyed the show, didn’t you?” I continue to smile and make a final bow before leaving the room. After raising my chin and staring at Tamir's treble eyes for the last ime, a last tease escapes my lips, “You’re just disappointed there’s no encore.”<br>
__<br>
<br>
<br>
A canvas, where does a woman find a canvas? This question I ponder while I fiddle with the old leather bag that swings besides my leg. The coins it contains still feel cold, metal wakes so slowly. With every step I take, they move, clash and tingle. A ballad of that which makes the world go round. The people inhabiting these streets more than fancy the music, so I take the sheepskin under my arm to subdue the sound.<br>
<br>
A canvas, where does a woman find a canvas? It still haunts me. A tailor that does not know of Shula is one that is hard to find. Good tailors are few in Rayt and this money is worthless unless spent properly. The people that live here must get used to it. They might wonder what’s the big deal. But I’m concerned with how I look. <br>
<br>
“I extend my humble greetings, miss Shula. You honour us with your presence.”<br>
<br>
I gamble and I lose. The years have left dust on Lamya’s memories and I searched for hours.  It feels like I’ve seen a thousand avenues. When I finally found a tailor, I took a chance and stepped inside, but one of his students recognised me the moment I set foot in the small house. <br>
<br>
“Sorry, you mistake me for someone else.” I cut him off. The boy looks me in the face in disbelief, I stare right back in his. “I am Lamya Bint Ghayt. I am looking for your master. Is he in?”<br>
<br>
The student nods and scuffles away, but he keeps bending his neck to look at me, he thinks I don’t notice, but quickly focuses his eyes on the door when I bust him. When he pulls the latch, I turn. Where there was nothing before, now a man stands. Scrawny and tall of build. He smiles at me with his rotten teeth and makes an attempt at a bow. “Sorry to scare you ma’am.” He says and steps aside. I lift my foot and shift my weight forwards, moving towards the exit. <br>
<br>
“Blocked?”<br>
<br>
“Yes, ma’am.” The lanky man answered. He pulls some unfinished textures off the nearby cabinet. I watch as the cloth falls apart before even touching the ground; the few stitches weren’t enough to hold it together. He shifts the cupboard in front of the door through which the boy just left. I’m locked inside. <br>
<br>
For the first time I take a good look at the man, I noticed his posture, before, tall and thin. He’s wearing filthy clothing, it used to be white but now it’s been recoloured by nature. A sheathed blade dangles around the man’s waist. His skin shows deep contours, his dark-grey hair falls down his ears. There are several scars on his face, but most disappear in the hair of his unshaven face.<br>
<br>
“Tough boys come out to ruffle my feathers?” <br>
<br>
The man reveals his dark and yellow teeth for a second time. “Hush Shula,” He whispers. “I know you get cynical when you’re nervous.” He unsheathes the saif, swings with it viciously and continues to approach me slowly, but because of his pathetic figure it’s not as impressive or threatening as he had meant it to be.<br>
<br>
“You’re well informed.” I say, while I reach for Tabassum’s hilt. I swing my hair onto my back. My wards whirl along, concealing my hand’s move “Who sent you?”<br>
<br>
“A wealthy man you’ve angered ma’am. Your pretty head fetches me a pretty price. Been into the business this long and this gentleman offers me enough to retire…”<br>
<br>
I chuckle. “All your life you’ve been waiting for this chance, you’ve got the guts and you got the blade, but boy you’d better check your luck.” My fingers clammed around the hilt and within a singly fluent movement the belt transforms into several long metal fingers. They entangle the man’s leg and I pull. He slams on his back, but nor the impact, nor the surprise were enough to let him lose his grip on his weapon. Tabassum changes to its weapon form and I smash my Khopesh into the exit blockade, a trailer cleverly hiding the entrance. From the other side it probably looks as if the tailor doesn’t even exist. The steel slashes it’s way through the wooden side, enough to create an opening. I rush through a cloud of dust and splintered wood. A bolt gives chase, but my aggressor is a poor marksman. The projectile missed and pierces itself through the other wand of the caravan. I hurry to the left, where there is light and exit the trailer. <br>
<br>
That man didn’t have a crossbow before and he couldn’t have hid it either. He was too thin and his wardrobe was practically falling around him. Was his blade infused with a djinn? That could mean trouble…

							Jared walked down he halls of the Masdar's palace to his study, evidently the Masdar had something for him to do...again. It wasn't really surprising, very rarely did the Masdar not have something for Jared to do, usually it was some small task but every once in a while it would be something big.<br>
<br>
Jared was personally, very tired, so he hoped it wasn't nothing too important. Soon he came to the door, and he calmly knocked and a voice said "Enter." Jared proceeded to pass through the portal after opening. Sitting down behind a desk covered with papers and a map here and there, was the Masdar, furiously writing on paper in his book-lined study, there was a gentle fire burning in a fireplace at the far side of the room, keeping it warm. The Masder looked up, he looked tired, his face drawn and haggard.<br>
<br>
"Ah Jared, there you are, please...sit down..." Jared obeyed calmly and sat down in a plush chair. "You look tired my lord, when was the last time you slept." The Masdar waved his hand irritably "I have little time for that, things have been going awry in a hurry." Jared was confused "What do you mean my lord?" The Masder grunted and pulled forward and map and stabbed his finger at a spot "THIS!"<br>
<br>
The spot was simply called "Agradam Wastes." Jared blinked and in his confusion said "I don't understand." He winced at his forgetting the title. The Masdar took no notice "THAT is the area where a group of bandits have been raiding from and causing havoc, there leader is very clever and apparently they have a large number of djinni class weapons, and I have heard rumors the leader has one infused with an elfreet, very dangerous, combined with that and his cunning, as well as the dangers of where they are, he has become a serious problem."<br>
<br>
"What dangers?" Jared asked, the Masdar grimly said "The Agradam Wastes is land that is dangerous due to the large number of sandcrawlers that inhabit it, I am stymied as to how the bandits can not only survive but prosper there, it defies all logic." Jared frowned, sandcrawlers were enourmously dangerous, the fact the bandits could survive was indeed troubling.<br>
<br>
"You see Jared, I need someone who can get in there and survive, I need you, to go into the Agradam Wastes, and gain more information on these bandits, no one else has succeeded but I believe you can."<br>
<br>
Jared nodded and said "When do I go?"<br>
<br>
The Masdar said "Now...you may go..." Jared proceeded to start leaving but as he did the Masdar said "Oh and Jared," Jared looked back "Look out for a rather dangerous critter called the Sand King, he's like any other sandcrawler, except much larger, and much more clever and dangerous, few have seen him and lived..."

							<i>Sssshft... clank... sssshft...</i>Those noises were becoming familiar. The sounds of metal links and sand, a sigh from a small, firmly set mouth and then the shuffle of her clothes and shoes as she sits in the sand to study a writing line along the ground in front of her mat. The lines mean something. This time nothing overly interesting, she must be creative to give the customer their money's worth. The chain seems to burn in her hand, and she can fell the pendulum tugging toward the sand. Vellu had more to say to the plump housewife who was sitting before her, quivering like a child or a criminal ready to be caught doing what they ought not be doing. <br>
<br>
Vellu's designs become more. Ideas, thoughts, words... She only has an impression. "You will lose a great deal of money today if you are not very careful...If you do not act quickly it will be disasterous." The girl child reached behind her and holds a fragile glass vial in front of the woman's eyes. "For you. You will know when to use it." The mystery she put behind her voice was a creative little game she had started playing with time. As they people became more weary of her, she became a much better "witch". For a people with very little superstition they were often afraid of the unexplainable. <br>
<br>
The woman took the vial, and her advice and paid a small amount. Rena tucked the money away and looked up at the sky before turning her head to watch the woman leave. There was nothing special in the vial. It was simply water and a rather potent spice that would burn eyes and skin. The would be purse snatcher that Vellu had predicted would be in for a nasty surprise if the woman was quick. If not someone would get the woman's grocery money. It made little difference to Rena as she stood and picked up her mat and moved along the roads. The sun was getting higher. In the main streets it would be warmer and she would have a better crowd. The backstreets were filled with a harder sort usually. They made their own futures. Vellu was never as good at predicting them as with the simple day to day happenings of normal men and women. <br>
<br>
She set up again, Vellu hanging around her neck like some sort of fashion statement. The mat was on a sandy piece of ground next to a set of flat steps that led up onto the Market. She didnt need to shout out her wears like the people around. A twelve year old child sitting out in the sun in layers of dark clothing was hard to miss. Especially when this was the description that was passed around to anyone wanting to know their future. She sat and waited, making patterns with Vellu, small things slipping into her mind. The old man buying fruit across the way would peacefully die in his sleep. She didnt know when. The woman with child that had just walked past would have a daughter. She got to know these people very well and they would never stop to ask her name. She was used to it, but it was almost lonely.

							As Wasim was walking through the back streets, looking around for the girl in the sketch, a young woman ran into him. She had lost her balance, and Wasim grabbed her shoulder to help her regain it, as she stood in front of him, and she seemed upset and in a hurry and Wasim recognized her instantly. Deep chick bones, a triangular face and overall majestic appearance... yes this is without a doubt the woman he wants to protect. He was about to remove his hand and greet her but suddenly, her eyes tore wide open, her skin and turned pale, and her hands turned to her throat that was now impaled by a crossbow bolt. She choked, and croaked, and as blood gushed from her mouth, she collapsed on the ground, lifeless.<br>
<br>
And at the same time she dies, she was also standing, on top of her own lifeless body, unaware of the fact that she that her life can end in a split second. Wasim quickly pushed the woman away, and behind her a crossbow bolt soared through the air, and with a swift motion, Wasim grabbed it while airborne. He then turned his attention towards the shooter, who in turn looked at him, with eyes filled with fright and admiration. It was just another unsuccessful assassin. There was no reason for worry.<br>
<br>
"Azra'ill?!" cried the man, as he ran towards him. "W-were you hired to kill that woman too? I am very sorry, I did not know, if I had known I would have never gone after her" He said in a groveling voice as he stopped in front of Wasim. <br>
<br>
"I don't go by that name anymore… and I was not hired for such a thing" <br>
<br>
"Then are the rumors did you really stop killing" asked the man in a disappointed tone<br>
<br>
"Yes, all I want now is to protect the well being of that woman" <br>
<br>
"Again you go protecting women?!" said the man laughing. "Did you not learn your lesson from your ordeal with L--"<br>
<br>
A laud crack was heard as Wasim snapped the bolt in his hand in half "Do not speak that name" hissed Wasim.<br>
<br>
The man loaded his crossbow and aimed it at Wasim's heart, then began pronouncing the name slowly while smirking widely, "Le--"<br>
<br>
<br>
He did not reach past the first syllable though, because before he could, Wasim had already stood behind him, his sword unsheathed and touching lightly on the man's throat. The man shrieked and quivered in fear and dropped his weapon. Wasim then pressed, and as the first drops of blood appeared where blade crossed skin, he drew his head closer to the man and whispered in his ear. <br>
<br>
"Do not let me catch you uttering her name again," he said "since I might not be able to contain myself in the future" The man swallowed hard and nodded in response. Wasim then pushed him to the ground.<br>
<br>
<br>
"Now go, and tell your employer, that death itself is protecting this woman"

							Cowl billowing lightly around her curved form in the warm breeze, Khalidah watched the streets of Rayt from the pleasant cool of the tavern's shade, back resting gently upon the rough sandstone and arms folded loosely. In the haze of heat already radiating from the golden ground, the large tawny shape of the temple loomed - almost looking ominous with the huge circular chasm of the entrance as a gaping mouth and sandy steps like jagged teeth - a few people hurrying to pay their daily tribute. Huffing once through her nose, Khalidah shoved herself away from the wall, dark eyes narrowed in the shadowed slit of her burnoose. <i>Fools.</i> The only way a man - or woman - ever prospered in life was solely by their own means and wit. To rely on the benevolence of beings that are invisible and intangible was simply nothing more than foolishness. Look where it had got her.<br>
<br>
Her feet, as always, were making their own way across the city, taking her inconspicuously through the crowds as she had done every day since she had relied on no-one but herself to see her through the day. Dust swirled around her tarnished gold sandles, coating her tanned feet in a comforting layer of fine sand grains, yet she paid no mind, her eyes sweeping the busy market and her ears continually pricked for any piece of useful information they may happen upon. You never knew when your luck would turn.<br>
<br>
A small movement caught her eye - a glint of steel on the edge of her peripheral vision - and Khalidah turned her head to investigate, noticing the darkened figure crouched inconspicuously at the bottom of the market steps. Metal swung lazily over the ground - almost hypnotising in its regularity - and before she could stop herself, she was making her way over. Even more of a curiosity was that the strange figure was a child - barely at the cusp of adulthood, no less. <br>
<br>
Cocking her head to one side, Khalidah observed the girl from behind for a short while, her slender arms folded beneath her cloak. Eventually, the child paused and the young woman took the brief moment to speak. "<br>
<br>
You should not be out on the streets this early, child," she said in an undertone and though her mouth didn't move, her eyes showed more than simple curiosity, "It isn't safe. Go claim sanctuary at the temple, if you must, though little good that will do you." The latter she muttered in an undertone, shrouded face turning automatically to survey the building mentioned, for as much as she disliked the place, no-one could say that it wasn't safe. <br>
<br>
Absently, Khalidah rummaged at her belt, procuring a single copper coin and tossing it to the floor before the girl, meeting her blue-ish gaze with a disarming smile. "The baker over there will sell you a loaf for that," she told the child, flashing a wink, "and if he doesn't, well, then more fool him: return to me and I'll get you something else instead."
